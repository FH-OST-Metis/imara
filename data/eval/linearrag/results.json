It is common to compare the concentration changes of compounds in the same metabolic pathway between two groups of samples, i.e., to assess the up- or down-regulation of a certain pathway. The definitions of upregulation and down-regulation are actually derived from the principle of chemical equilibrium shifts. For example, the overall equation of the urea cycle can be simplified as 2 NH 3 + CO 2 + 3 ATP + 3 H 2 O \u2192 urea + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP . Traditionally, if the concentration of urea, ADP, Pi, or AMP in the experimental group is higher than in the control group, and the concentration of ammonia, carbon dioxide, or ATP is lower in the experimental group compared to the control group, biochemists would say that the urea cycle is up-regulated. This definition stems from the irreversible nature of this cycle and is analogous to the equilibrium shift in chemistry. Since the urea cycle is a synthetic reaction, it is sometimes said that the anabolic process is dominant. Conversely, it is described as down-regulated, and the catabolic process is dominant."

It is common to compare the concentration changes of compounds in the same metabolic pathway between two groups of samples, i.e., to assess the up- or down-regulation of a certain pathway. The definitions of upregulation and down-regulation are actually derived from the principle of chemical equilibrium shifts. For example, the overall equation of the urea cycle can be simplified as 2 NH 3 + CO 2 + 3 ATP + 3 H 2 O \u2192 urea + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP . Traditionally, if the concentration of urea, ADP, Pi, or AMP in the experimental group is higher than in the control group, and the concentration of ammonia, carbon dioxide, or ATP is lower in the experimental group compared to the control group, biochemists would say that the urea cycle is up-regulated. This definition stems from the irreversible nature of this cycle and is analogous to the equilibrium shift in chemistry. Since the urea cycle is a synthetic reaction, it is sometimes said that the anabolic process is dominant. Conversely, it is described as down-regulated, and the catabolic process is dominant.",

It is common to compare the concentration changes of compounds in the same metabolic pathway between two groups of samples, i.e., to assess the up- or down-regulation of a certain pathway. The definitions of upregulation and down-regulation are actually derived from the principle of chemical equilibrium shifts. For example, the overall equation of the urea cycle can be simplified as 2 NH 3 + CO 2 + 3 ATP + 3 H 2 O \u2192 urea + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP . Traditionally, if the concentration of urea, ADP, Pi, or AMP in the experimental group is higher than in the control group, and the concentration of ammonia, carbon dioxide, or ATP is lower in the experimental group compared to the control group, biochemists would say that the urea cycle is up-regulated. This definition stems from the irreversible nature of this cycle and is analogous to the equilibrium shift in chemistry. Since the urea cycle is a synthetic reaction, it is sometimes said that the anabolic process is dominant. Conversely, it is described as down-regulated, and the catabolic process is dominant.",

Even when comparisons are made within the same individuals over time, the change in the amount of certain compounds cannot conclusively determine the direction of the balance shift of a specific pathway, as one compound can be part of several pathways. For example, although urea is a product of the urea cycle, it can also be a product of other metabolic pathways. For instance, arginine, a nitrogen-containing amino acid, can be converted into L-ornithine and urea through the catalysis of L-arginine amidinohydrolase. Additionally, urea serves as the starting material for many metabolic pathways. It can be directly eliminated from the body, converted into carbon dioxide, or synthesized into allophanic acid. This means that if the urea concentration in the experimental group increases, several possibilities could be responsible: the metabolic pathway from arginine to ornithine may be up-regulated, or the downstream pathways may be blocked for some reason in the experimental group.",

Metabolomics refers to the large-scale study of small molecules. High-throughput mass spectrometry experiments can collect thousands of mass spectra in just minutes, providing a unique advantage over other analytical methods. The fragmentation pattern of a molecule, or the mass spectrum, can offer valuable structural information about the molecule. However, the annotation of these spectra is typically limited to compounds for which reference spectra are available in libraries or databases [11-14]. Only a small fraction of spectra can be accurately assigned precise chemical structures in nontargeted tandem mass spectrometry studies, which is a prerequisite for pathway analysis [15,16].

The complexity of metabolic network, where a single compound can play a part in multiple pathways, poses a challenge in inferring metabolic balance changes over time or after different treatments. Isotopic labeling experiment is the standard method to infer metabolic flux, which is currently defined as the flow of a single metabolite through a given pathway over time. However, there is still no way to accurately infer the metabolic balance changes after different treatments in an experiment. This study introduces a different concept: molecular weight distribution, which is the empirical distribution of the molecular weights of all metabolites of interest.

For both CA and CO, purine-related metabolism shows a shift towards catabolism and centrabolism compared to the healthy volunteers (Table 2), which aligns with a previous study indicating that purine metabolism, the hydrolysis of phosphate molecules into nucleosides, is significantly up-regulated after SARSCoV-2 infection [7]. Acylcarnitine-related pathways also exhibit a tendency towards catabolism and centrabolism (Table 2). This conclusion, which does not require knowledge of individual compounds within the acylcarnitine class, was also emphasized by Yang et al. [6]. It was observed that long-chain acylcarnitines were generally lower in both convalescent groups, while medium-chain acylcarnitines displayed the opposite pattern [6]. For both CA and CO, metabolism related to carbohydrates shifts towards anabolism and centrabolism compared to healthy volunteers (Table 2). This might be due to elevated glucose levels in COVID19 patients [8]. Additionally, pathways related to organoheterocyclic compounds are shown to lean towards centrabolism, while benzenoidrelated pathways shift towards anabolism and duobolism.",

Metabolomics refers to the large-scale study of small molecules. High-throughput mass spectrometry experiments can collect thousands of mass spectra in just minutes, providing a unique advantage over other analytical methods. The fragmentation pattern of a molecule, or the mass spectrum, can offer valuable structural information about the molecule. However, the annotation of these spectra is typically limited to compounds for which reference spectra are available in libraries or databases [11-14]. Only a small fraction of spectra can be accurately assigned precise chemical structures in nontargeted tandem mass spectrometry studies, which is a prerequisite for pathway analysis [15,16]. Moreover, many metabolic pathways are still undiscovered or poorly understood, so in practice, often more than half of the metabolites cannot be assigned to any pathways.",

For both CA and CO, purine-related metabolism shows a shift towards catabolism and centrabolism compared to the healthy volunteers (Table 2), which aligns with a previous study indicating that purine metabolism, the hydrolysis of phosphate molecules into nucleosides, is significantly up-regulated after SARSCoV-2 infection [7]. Acylcarnitine-related pathways also exhibit a tendency towards catabolism and centrabolism (Table 2). This conclusion, which does not require knowledge of individual compounds within the acylcarnitine class, was also emphasized by Yang et al. [6]. It was observed that long-chain acylcarnitines were generally lower in both convalescent groups, while medium-chain acylcarnitines displayed the opposite pattern [6]. For both CA and CO, metabolism related to carbohydrates shifts towards anabolism and centrabolism compared to healthy volunteers (Table 2).

The complexity of metabolic network, where a single compound can play a part in multiple pathways, poses a challenge in inferring metabolic balance changes over time or after different treatments. Isotopic labeling experiment is the standard method to infer metabolic flux, which is currently defined as the flow of a single metabolite through a given pathway over time. However, there is still no way to accurately infer the metabolic balance changes after different treatments in an experiment. This study introduces a different concept: molecular weight distribution, which is the empirical distribution of the molecular weights of all metabolites of interest. By estimating the differences of the location and scale estimates of these distributions, it becomes possible to quantitatively infer the metabolic balance changes even without requiring knowledge of the exact chemical structures of these compounds and their related pathways. This research article provides a mathematical framing for a classic biological concept.",
            "passage-b672df43f1133a1f94864f4b68cb4e03": "Metabolic pathways consist of enzyme-mediated biochemical reactions that are commonly categorized into two main processes within a living organism: biosynthesis (known as anabolism) and breakdown (known as catabolism) of molecules. It is common to compare the concentration changes of compounds in the same metabolic pathway between two groups of samples, i.e., to assess the up- or down-regulation of a certain pathway. The definitions of upregulation and down-regulation are actually derived from the principle of chemical equilibrium shifts. For example, the overall equation of the urea cycle can be simplified as 2 NH 3 + CO 2 + 3 ATP + 3 H 2 O \u2192 urea + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP . Traditionally, if the concentration of urea, ADP, Pi, or AMP in the experimental group is higher than in the control group, and the concentration of ammonia, carbon dioxide, or ATP is lower in the experimental group compared to the control group, biochemists would say that the urea cycle is up-regulated. This definition stems from the irreversible nature of this cycle and is analogous to the equilibrium shift in chemistry. Since the urea cycle is a synthetic reaction, it is sometimes said that the anabolic process is dominant. Conversely, it is described as down-regulated, and the catabolic process is dominant.",

For example, although urea is a product of the urea cycle, it can also be a product of other metabolic pathways. For instance, arginine, a nitrogen-containing amino acid, can be converted into L-ornithine and urea through the catalysis of L-arginine amidinohydrolase. Additionally, urea serves as the starting material for many metabolic pathways. It can be directly eliminated from the body, converted into carbon dioxide, or synthesized into allophanic acid. This means that if the urea concentration in the experimental group increases, several possibilities could be responsible: the metabolic pathway from arginine to ornithine may be up-regulated, or the downstream pathways may be blocked for some reason in the experimental group."
