Acylcarnitine-related pathways also exhibit a tendency towards catabolism and centrabolism (Table 2). This conclusion, which does not require knowledge of individual compounds within the acylcarnitine class, was also emphasized by Yang et al. [6]. It was observed that long-chain acylcarnitines were generally lower in both convalescent groups, while medium-chain acylcarnitines displayed the opposite pattern [6]. For both CA and CO, metabolism related to carbohydrates shifts towards anabolism and centrabolism compared to healthy volunteers (Table 2).

It is common to compare the concentration changes of compounds in the same metabolic pathway between two groups of samples, i.e., to assess the up- or down-regulation of a certain pathway. The definitions of upregulation and down-regulation are actually derived from the principle of chemical equilibrium shifts. For example, the overall equation of the urea cycle can be simplified as 2 NH 3 + CO 2 + 3 ATP + 3 H 2 O \u2192 urea + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP . Traditionally, if the concentration of urea, ADP, Pi, or AMP in the experimental group is higher than in the control group, and the concentration of ammonia, carbon dioxide, or ATP is lower in the experimental group compared to the control group, biochemists would say that the urea cycle is up-regulated.
