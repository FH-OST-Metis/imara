## Abstract

Case studies are typically used to teach 'ethics', but emphasize narrative. When the content of a course is focused on formulae and proofs, it can seem divergent or distracting - for both  instructor  and  learner  -  to  introduce  a  case  analysis.  Moreover,  case  analyses  are typically focused on issues relating to people: obtaining consent, dealing with research team  members,  and/or  potential  institutional  policy  violations.  While  relevant  to  some research, not all students in quantitative courses plan to become researchers, and ethical practice - of mathematics, statistics, data science, and computing - is an essential topic regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  learner  intends  to  do  research.  It  is  a  mistake  to  treat 'training in ethical practice' and 'training in responsible conduct of research' as the same thing,  just  as  incorrect  as  it  is  to  assume  that  'training  in  ethical  practice'  is  the  same irrespective of what the learner will actually be practicing. Ethical reasoning is a way of thinking that requires the individual to assess what they know about a potential ethical problem - their prerequisite knowledge, and in some cases, how behaviors they observe, are directed to perform, or have performed, diverge from what they know to be ethical behavior. Ethical reasoning is a learnable, improvable set of knowledge, skills, and abilities that enable learners to recognize what they do and do not know about what constitutes 'ethical practice' of a discipline, and in some cases, to contemplate alternative decisions about how to first recognize, and then proceed past, or respond to, such divergences. A stakeholder analysis is part of prerequisite knowledge, and can be used whether there is or is not an actual case or behavior/situation to react to. When teaching courses with primarily quantitative content, a stakeholder analysis is a useful tool for instruction and assessment of learning. It can be used to both integrate authentic ethical content and encourage careful quantitative thought. This paper discusses how to introduce ethical reasoning, stakeholder analysis, and ethical practice standards authentically in quantitative courses.

Key Words: teaching  ethics,  ethical  reasoning,  ASA  Ethical  Guidelines,  stakeholder analysis, case analysis, ethical practice.

## 1. Introduction

' Ethics refers to standards and practices that tell us how human beings ought to act in the many situations  in  which  they  find  themselves-as  friends,  parents,  children,  citizens, businesspeople, professionals, and so on. Ethics is also concerned with our character. It requires knowledge, skills, and habits.' This definition of ethics comes from the Markkula Center for Applied ethics at Santa Clara University, where a wide variety of tools and resources  for  promoting  ethics  (and  applied  ethics)  are  created  and  housed.  However, 'teaching ethics' is too vague of a task for any individual instructor teaching statistics or data science in higher education. Recently, encouragement to incorporate 'ethics' into the curricula for statistics (ASA, 2014) and for data science (National Academies, 2018) has been published for undergraduate degree programs. The ASA Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate  Programs  in  Statistical  Science state  that,  'ethical  issues  should  be incorporated throughout a program' (p. 13), i.e., the program remains focused on statistical science  and  'ethical  issues'  should  be  encountered  'throughout'  that  program.  The Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report (GAISE College Report Revision Committee, 2016) also includes a goal, among the 'desired result of all introductory statistics courses', that specifically  targets  'an  awareness  of ethical  issues associated  with  sound  statistical practice' (emphasis in original; p. 8). In a nuanced difference, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies 2018) seems to go further by integrating ethics into the definition of data science: 'data science spans a broad(er) array of  activities  that  involve  applying  principles  for  data  collection,  storage,  integration, analysis, inference, communication, and ethics '. (emphasis added, p. 1) This inclusion of ethics  into  the  definition  of  the  domain  is  intentional;  the  authors  of  this  report,  the Committee on Envisioning the Data Science Discipline, note that their emphasis (on ethics in the definition of data science):

'… underscores the centrality of studying the many ethical considerations that arise as workers engage in data science . These considerations include deciding what data to collect, obtaining permissions to use data, crediting the sources of data properly, validating the data's  accuracy,  taking  steps  to  minimize  bias,  safeguarding  the  privacy  of  individuals referenced in the data, and using the data correctly and without alteration. It is important that  students  learn  to  recognize  ethical  issues  and  to  apply  a  high  ethical  standard.' (emphasis added, p. 2).

Two of the 2018 National Academies report action items (p.3) follow directly from the Committee's focus on the centrality of ethical professional practice in data science:

Recommendation 2.4: Ethics  is  a  topic  that,  given  the  nature  of  data  science,  students should learn and practice throughout their education. Academic institutions should ensure that ethics is woven into the data science curriculum from the beginning and throughout.

Recommendation 2.5: The data science community should adopt a code of ethics; such a code should be affirmed by members of professional societies, included in professional development programs and curricula, and conveyed through educational programs. The code should be reevaluated often in light of new developments.

As has been argued elsewhere (Tractenberg 2022-A, 2022-B; Tractenberg, 2020; Hogan et al. 2017), the ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice (ASA 2022) represent ethical practice  standards  that  comprise  both  statistics  and  data  science.  In  particular,  the concordance of the professional practitioner communities for statistics (i.e., the ASA) and computing (Association of Computing Machinery, ACM, 2018) have longstanding ethical practice standards that are highly aligned (2018 versions discussed in Tractenberg 2020; 2018 ACM and 2022 ASA versions discussed in Tractenberg 2022-A, 2022-B). To the extent that the ASA and ACM describe the ethical practice standards of professionals in computing, statistics, and data science, 'the data science community' already has access to  the  ASA  Guidelines  to  utilize  as  its  'code  of  ethics'.  Clearly,  the  professional  and scientific communities are placing increasing value and importance on the integration of 'ethics' or ethical content into the curriculum for degrees in statistics and data science. This content exists. A remaining challenge is how to integrate both the content and how to reason  with  it  into  the  entire  curriculum  (in  statistics  and/or  data  science).  Whenever courses  in  this  curriculum  are  primarily  quantitative,  featuring  formulae,  theories,  and proofs rather than applications, the opportunities to integrate ethical practice content appear to be limited.

## 2. Options for 'teaching ethics'

The ASA (2014), GAISE (2016), and National Academies (2018) recommendations are not  specific  about  what,  or  how,  ethical  content  or  'ethical  issues'  can  effectively  be integrated into either a single course (e.g., a target for an introductory statistics course; GAISE 2016) or the  curriculum  (ASA  2014;  National  Academies  2018).  As  has  been discussed previously (Tractenberg, 2016?), simply attaching the ethical practice standards (ASA,  ACM)  to  the  syllabus  will  not  be  effective.  Limiting  instruction  to  in-class discussion  of  examples  of  unethical  application(s)  of  statistics  (e.g.,  unsubstantiable analyses supporting claims of voter fraud in 2020 election; deploying algorithms to steal Facebook data from unwilling or unknowing data donors in 2016), and how they violate laws,  rules,  or  ethical  practice  standards  definitely  engages  student  attention.  These examples also highlight the importance of learning statistics and data science - so, they don't simply present a social or cultural 'good' that is both abstract and possibly unrelated to  quantitative  content  (e.g.,  beneficence  and  nonmaleficence;  Beauchamp  &amp;  Childress 1984). In order to inculcate students with a sense of responsibility for ethical statistical and data science practice, a coherent approach to teaching, and to assessing learning, is needed throughout a semester or term.

## 2.1 Case studies

Case studies are typically  used -  and  recommended - to teach 'ethics'. Cases that are available (the development and sharing of many cases have been supported by the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health) are universally contextualized well beyond formulae and proofs of theorems, lemmas, or corollaries. The National Institutes of Health Office of Intramural Research describes case studies for teaching/learning ethics this way: ' Research Ethics Cases are a tool for discussing scientific integrity. Cases are designed to confront the readers with a specific problem that does not lend itself to easy answers. By providing a focus for discussion, cases help staff involved in research to define or  refine  their  own  standards,  to  appreciate  alternative  approaches  to  identifying  and resolving ethical problems, and to develop skills for dealing with hard problems on their own .' 1 (emphasis added.)

1 https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/ethical-conduct/responsible-conduct-research-training/annualreview-ethics-case-studies

In addition to the fact that all those who teach statistical and data science practices have an obligation  to  teach  ethical  statistical  and  data  science  practice  (i.e.,  the  topic  of  ASA Principle Elements A12, G, and G1; ASA, 2022), the use of case studies as defined by the NIH can be generally challenging across statistical instruction for several reasons:

1. Unless  the  instructor  is  willing  to  add  instruction/dedicate  time  to  providing feedback on narrative responses from students (e.g., essays, open-ended responses), there is no way to effectively assess if/how students are learning or progressing.
2. Without  written  work  reflecting  the  students'  engagement  with  the  case,  the instructor has no way to assess learning.
3. Cases may present interesting ethical cases without relating in an authentic way to applying the ethical content.
4. If a course does not utilize narrative - in content or in assessment - then teaching and  assessing  learning  with  case  studies  might  be  very  different  from  what instructors and students are familiar with. This can create challenges for students as well as for the instructors.

Moreover, it is essential to point out that the National Academies and  ASA recommendations are not about research ethics but about ethical practice . This means that materials currently available to teach 'research ethics' - none of which have been created to support quantitative instructors or courses with primarily quantitative content - will be useful  for  teaching  'ethical  practice'.  That  is,  special  consideration  for  how  to  teach practitioners  to  be  ethical  when  they  use  mathematics  or  statistics  is  fundamentally different from training researchers in 'responsible conduct of research'.

When the content of a course is focused on formulae and proofs, it can seem divergent or distracting to introduce a case analysis. Moreover, case analyses are typically focused on issues relating to people: obtaining consent, dealing with research team members, and/or potential institutional policy violations. Finally, cases describe actions taken by multiple parties with different roles. This is certainly one way to help students learn about ethical guidelines (or applicable rules, policies, and laws) - as they determine which of these were violated (or might have been threatened) by actors in the case. However, this approach has no way to help students appreciate how ethical practice standards -such as the ASA Ethical Guidelines  for  Statistical  Practice  (or  other  rules)  can  be  used  to  practice  ethically  in general. The case approach emphasizes identification of 'what went wrong' -i.e., require the learner to understand the context of scientific application of what they are in the course to begin learning, and then typically, the articulation of a response. The structure of cases (as defined by the National Institutes of Health) is to be intentionally ambiguous and not include objectively right or wrong responses. Thus, 'what to do' when faced with similar situations may not be made clear to learners, or, multiple options may be presented and a clear way to make a decision about what to do in response might again be unclear.

In addition to the fact that beginners or those who are starting to integrate their quantitative knowledge might not appreciate the multitude of complexities involved in participating in a scientific project or team, teaching 'responsible conduct of research' with cases that are ill-defined makes it difficult to consider how to identify similar - also ill-defined - situations in the future. Moreover, cases that present completed events and ask students to determine 'what went wrong' helps to promote the idea that avoiding bad behavior, or avoiding being caught in bad behavior, is what constitutes ethical research. A final problem with typical case-based teaching of ethics is that the majority of materials that exist were developed for academic and research situations specifically. Newer resources for 'ethical AI', such as those from the Princeton Dialogues on AI and Ethics (https://aiethics.princeton.edu/casestudies/case-study-pdfs/), are not specific to research, but they do feature 'ethical issues' that are general. Unfortunately, like older cases, these do not relate to 'ethical practice'. They also tend to be self-contained, and unrelated/not relatable to quantitative material.

While  quantitative  courses  are  undoubtedly  relevant  to  students  in  research  or  science majors, not all students in quantitative courses plan to become researchers, and ethical practice - of mathematics, statistics, data science, and computing - is an essential topic regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  learner  intends  to  do  research.  In  addition  to  the  four classroom-based,  instructor-specific difficulties that arise  when  quantitative  course instructors want to integrate ethical content into their course, the available cases will often be quite far from being both useful and accessible to these instructors.

## 2.2 Teaching Ethical Reasoning instead of 'ethics'

' Ethics is the effort to guide one's conduct with careful reasoning . One cannot simply claim 'X is wrong.'; Rather, one needs to claim 'X is wrong because (fill in the blank)'.' (Briggle &amp; Mitcham, 2012, p. 38). (emphasis added)

Ethical  reasoning is  a  process  that  can  be  learned  and  improved.  It  can  be  taught and assessed. There are six elements of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that are required for ethical reasoning (Tractenberg &amp; FitzGerald, 2012; Tractenberg 2022-A):

1. Identify and 'quantify' prerequisite knowledge
2. Identify decision-making frameworks.
3. Identify or recognize the ethical issue.
4. Identify and evaluate alternative actions (on the ethical issue).
5. Make and justify a decision.
6. Reflect on the decision.

While it has been argued that ethical reasoning (rather than ethics) is what statistics and data science curricula should be teaching and emphasizing, it can be challenging to get to, or beyond, KSA #3 (identify or recognize the ethical issue) when the course is featuring formulae,  proofs,  and  theorems.  Critically, proofs  and  formulae  typically  stipulate assumptions and approximations. Whenever these assumptions and approximations do not hold, cannot be met, or cannot be verified, it creates an opportunity to consider what the impacts of these failures might be . Even in a superficially abstract and quantitative context like  a  proof,  the  importance  of  assumptions  and  approximations  can  be  leveraged  to introduce ethical practice content.

As noted, ethical reasoning is a way of thinking that requires the individual to assess what they know about a potential ethical problem - their prerequisite knowledge, and in some cases to contemplate alternative decisions for responding to that problem. However, when learning  quantitative  content,  reasoning,  and  skills  (e.g.,  in  mathematical  statistics, mathematics, calculus, etc.), it can be distracting to students as well as instructors to have to divert attention to person-based considerations like behavior. There are six elements of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that are required for ethical reasoning. These are described in the context of mathematical content (i.e., formulae, proofs, theorems):

1. Identify  and  'quantify'  prerequisite  knowledge :  a  practitioner  should  have sufficient  familiarity  with  the  ASA  Ethical  Guidelines  for  Statistical  Practice (GLs) to identify at least one of the 72 elements that might be relevant to a given proof or theorem. This prerequisite knowledge is essential for ethical practice, as well as for deciding what to do when faced with requests to practice unethically,
2. so ensuring learners encounter them with respect to the mathematical foundations (as well as in applications later in the learning path) is important.
2. Identify decision-making frameworks . The ASA GLs represent a ' virtue ethics ' decision-making framework, which can be summarized as, 'what would the (ideal) ethical practitioner do in this case?' Alternatively, a utilitarian framework can be summarized as, 'how can benefits be maximized while harms are minimized?' Either of these approaches can be useful when considering what would happen if assumptions and approximations do not hold.
3. Identify or recognize the ethical issue : in quantitative courses, an ethical issue can arise from failing to considering the stakeholders - and impacts on them when assumptions and approximations do not hold.
4. Identify and evaluate alternative actions (on the ethical issue). There are always a set of decisions that can be made in any circumstance: either a) do nothing, b) consult or confer with a peer or a supervisor - using the professional guidelines or other resources, or c) report violations of policy, procedure, ethical guidelines, or law. When assumptions and approximations do not hold, the ethical practitioner is transparent, but 'do nothing' would mean  'not communicating that the theorem/proof is not applicable'-i.e., not being transparent. That is clearly always an option, but never an ethical one.
5. Make and justify a decision . A decision about what to do in the face of the ethical challenge that has been identified will be based on the alternatives. Justification would compare and contrast the alternatives from either the utilitarian or the virtue perspective; this is especially important if these perspectives ever differ on the course of action either supports best.
6. Reflect on the decision . For a course with mostly quantitative content, reflection may need to be targeted so as not to add too much narrative work (for the students to write and the instructor to grade). Examples of streamlined reflections could be: 1)  ask  for  the  most  problematic  assumptions/approximations  of  the  course  or section in the student's opinion, with a brief explanation of why that one is the most  problematic;  2)  ask  students  to  rank  order  most  to  least  problematic approximations  (NB:  reflection  cannot  be  graded  'right  or  wrong',  but  'do nothing'  is  always  unethical,  so  questions  about  'how  often  do  you  think mathematics practitioners decide to 'do nothing' will generate narrative that will be interesting, but might be hard to grade consistently).

Importantly, ethical reasoning can be integrated into a course, so that students can learn and practice all six aspects. However, unless the instructor also has cases or vignettes, ethical reasoning does not go beyond KSA #3, Identify or recognize the ethical issue . Moreover, in addition to learning the KSAs of ethical reasoning, and the ASA GLs (or similar ethical practice standard), the integration of ethical reasoning into a course requires additional material against which students can compare options in order to identify the ethical issue. For example, if the ASA Ethical Guidelines are used, then given a case or vignette, students can identify which ASA Ethical Guideline Principle(s) or elements are relevant - or have been violated - leading to the ethical issue under consideration. This can be done with a matching task, check boxes, or asking students to order a set of GL elements in terms of their relevance or importance to a violation of assumption or approximation. For eliciting narrative responses, instructors can choose a formula, proof or theorem and ask,  'What  decisions  are  made/have  been  made  in  (or  in  this  problem's  use  of)  this (proof/theorem)? Are assumptions, definitions, or approximations decisions? Can these affect stakeholders? If so, how; if not, why  not?'

## 2.3 Stakeholder analysis: a relevant subset of Ethical Reasoning

' Those who fund, contribute to, use, or are affected by statistical practices are considered stakeholders. The ethical statistical practitioner respects the interests of stakeholders while practicing in compliance with these Guidelines .' (ASA 2022; Principle C). As such, the impact of violations of assumptions or failures of approximations on stakeholders can be easily leveraged to integrate content about ethical statistics and data science practice into a quantitative course. Stakeholder analysis is part of Ethical Reasoning KSA #1, prerequisite knowledge (Tractenberg 2022-A, 2022-B). Importantly, stakeholder analysis can be used whether  there  is  or  is  not  an  actual  case  or  behavior/situation  to  react  to,  and  is  also independent  of  the  use  of  an  ethical  practice  standard  (Tractenberg,  2022-C).  Thus,  a stakeholder  analysis  can  be  useful  to  facilitate  ethical  practice  simply  by  alerting  the practitioner to harms and benefits - and to which stakeholders those accrue - of any step in their workflow or analysis. Even without a specific set of ethical practice guidelines in mind, the choice that minimizes harms can be made using the stakeholder analysis. It can also be used to augment the prerequisite knowledge of a formal ethical reasoning-based case analysis (Tractenberg 2022-B).

In  order  to  integrate  a  stakeholder  analysis  into  a  quantitative  course,  whenever  an approximation or assumption is made, attention can be brought to what happens if the assumption doesn't hold, at the limits of the approximation, or the inappropriate (doesn't fit the situation, isn't right for the data, assumes more than is known/knowable) use of the definition. Table 1 (adapted from Tractenberg 2019) focuses attention on harms/benefits to  create  a  simplified  'case  analysis'  that  can  be  utilized  with  any  formula,  proof,  or theorem if approximations and/or assumptions are included.

Table 1: Stakeholder Analysis of Harms and Benefits that accrue to seven stakeholder types

Stakeholder 1 :

HARM 4,5

BENEFIT 4,5

YOU 2,3

Your boss/client

Unknown individuals 2

Employer

Colleagues

Profession

Public/public trust

## Notes on stakeholder analysis table:

1. Knowing to whom harms may accrue can guide learners to where the ASA GLs or other ethical practice standards can assist in decision making.
2. Articulating the harms that may accrue to YOU (the individual) is essential for following advice to 'treat others' data as you would your own' (Loukides, Mason &amp; Patil, 2018: Chapter 3). Individuals need to recognize the harms that can accrue to  them before  they  can  compare  harms  to  themselves  and  harms  to  others. Moreover, 'others' data' could relate to data belonging to your boss/client, your employer, unknowable others, the scientific community, or the public. Recognizing whether or not benefits or harms accrue to these different types of 'others' is the only way to make a decision about how one wants other people to treat one's data: in someone else's table, you are the client, an unknowable other, or part of the public. Are some harms 'worse' or some benefits 'better'? Any
3. interested instructor can augment  the  stakeholder  analysis with additional discussion questions like these.
3. If there are no recognizable harms, and plausibly no 'unknowable' harms &lt;that would be caused by a failure of an assumption or approximation&gt;, then there can be  no  conflict.  It  is  really  important  to  recognize  whether  something  truly  is unknowable or if it is actually something that can be known - but we/the learner just don't/doesn't know it. The key words here are 'recognizable' and 'plausible' - the failure to recognize something doesn't mean it does not exist. And, beware of straw man 2 or red herring 3 harms!
4. If  there  are  plausible  harms  (or  benefits)  that  cannot  be  identified,  but  are believed/suspected  to  exist,  then  there  is  insufficient  information  to  make  a decision and more information is needed. Recognizing this - instead of making an uninformed decision - is currently not part of the norm. Learning how to use this table  and  complete  a  case  analysis  is  essential  for  enabling informed decisions about ethical challenges for current and future practitioners.
5. All harms are not the same; all the benefits are not the same; and harms and benefits are not exchangeable.

Whenever  assumptions  and/or  approximations  are  not  met,  there  may  be  impacts  on stakeholders. For example, if assumptions are not met and (but) the function/algorithm works as the employer desires, a harm accrues to the employer - because they're not getting accurate information or applicable/reproducible results but a benefit may seem to accrue to the individual ('you') because the work gets completed. If the timeline is tight, the boss may also seem to benefit from an approximation being used (because it looks like the boss got the work  done  on  time). Augmenting  the  discussion  of assumptions  and/or approximations for one construct (proof, theorem, definition, etc) can be limited to one per chapter, one per homework problem set or quiz, or one per week, depending on the ease of doing  this  given  the  content/topic.  Repeating  the  same  exercise  for  different  proofs  or assumptions/approximations  will  ensure  that  students  have  multiple  opportunities  to recognize and become competent at recognizing the impact of shortcuts and rules of thumb on stakeholders - and, offer opportunities to connect ethical practice ideas to real harms and benefits. Stakeholder analysis tables can be created with check boxes, matching, or other  forms  of  tasks  that  limit  the  need  for  narrative  responses  from  students,  but  still generate evaluable work products that can be graded. For eliciting narrative responses, instructors can choose one problem from each homework problem set and ask, 'Who could be  a  stakeholder  when  solving  a  problem  like  (one  chosen  from  the  homework assignment)?'

## 2.4  Using  the  ASA  Ethical  Guidelines  explicitly:  a  relevant  subset  of  Ethical Reasoning

Combining authentic ethical content with content that is more quantitative (i.e., featuring formulae, theorems, and proofs) is difficult, but directly incorporating the ASA Ethical Guidelines (included in the Appendix) can be done without a focus on ethical reasoning or stakeholder  analysis.  For  any  given  homework  problem  -  particularly  those  where applications of the formula or theorem are highlighted, questions can be asked that require

2 'Straw Man': defined as 'an argument, claim or opponent that is invented in order to win or create an argument', Cambridge English Dictionary.

3 'Red Herring': defined as 'something that takes attention away from a more important subject', Cambridge English Dictionary.

a matching or check-box answer (multiple choice), short answer, or narrative response. Questions can be structured in the following form:

Choose a problem from (a homework set) and consider what would happen if, instead of following ASA Ethical Guideline Principle A, the individual didn't use appropriate methodology? Is there an application of (what you're learning) where failing to follow Principle A could negatively impact any stakeholder - including yourself?

This same question can be (re)formulated for all of the ASA GL Principles (A-H). Since the Appendix is focused on organizations and institutions, those items are simple to exclude from this type of question; similarly since Principle G is about leadership type roles, those might also be omitted. (Principle G and the Appendix could be leveraged to encourage students  to  consider  attributes  of  the  workplaces  they  would  like  to  join  once  they graduate.) Instructors would ideally mention the GL Principles repeatedly throughout the course and other materials, and it is essential that the method by which students respond (narrative,  short  answer,  or  multiple  choice)  is  consistent  with  the  instructor's  learning objectives for the ethical content in the course (Tractenberg 2020; Tractenberg et al. 2020).

Other  GL  Principle  specific  questions,  that  require  the  same  attention  to  response generation and consistency with course learning objectives include:

Choose a problem from (a homework set) and consider what would happen if, instead  of  following  Principle  D,  someone  didn't  follow  applicable  rules  or guidelines? Is there an application of (what you're learning) where failing to follow Principle D could negatively impact any stakeholder - including yourself? (e.g., dual use of innovation, military and &lt;non-military&gt;)

Consider what would happen if, instead of following Principle E, someone on your working team wanted you to violate the ASA Ethical Guidelines because their profession  used  different  Guidelines?  Is  there  an  application  of  (what  you're learning)  where  failing  to  follow  the  ASA  Ethical  Guidelines  could  negatively impact any stakeholder - including yourself?

Do activities that could negatively impact the profession as a stakeholder have the potential  to  also  negatively  impact  yourself?  Consider  the  alternative  also:  do activities  that  positively  impact  the  profession  as  a  stakeholder  also  positively impact yourself?

It requires effort to introduce the idea of a stakeholder into a course in an authentic way. Also there have to be actions, or reactions, that the practitioner must make, for there to be plausible stakes for people to hold (given that the ' those who fund, contribute to, use, or are affected by statistical practices are considered stakeholders ' ). This is why we focus on the effects of failures of assumptions or approximations to hold as the point at which purely quantitative content (formula, proof, theorem) can begin to bear the integration of ethical content. These failures or violations require attention to both the formula, proof, or theorem (i.e., the actual target content of the course or lesson) and also to the possible harms or benefits that the otherwise purely quantitative content can have on stakeholders.

## 3. Integrating ethical content in a Mathematical Statistics course

An  undergraduate  course  in  Mathematical  Statistics  -  typically  the  first  exposure  for students in the major to the 'underpinnings' of statistical inference - has been revised for the 2022-23 Fall term to integrate ethical practice content. This was undertaken by one of us (ST) with input from the other (RET). This section presents the outline of the syllabus (without  timings  so  the  reader  can  map  to  their  own  term  (summer  session  or quarter/semester). Subsequent sections discuss the features and decisions represented in the syllabus, a fuller version of which is incliuded in the Appendix.

4 Two learning outcomes reflect the instructor's intention to prioritize not only the contextualization of statistical methods and theory in real world applications, but also the facts that a) statistical methods and theories have potential impacts on stakeholders; b) these impacts and stakeholders are important enough to feature at the learning outcome level (not as an aside); and c) there is more to learning the mathematical underpinnings of statistics than 'just math' stewardship, and responsibilities to the discipline, are also learnable and important to internalize.

5 The addition of ' Thoughtful use of ' to the Unit title signals to students that the focus moves beyond 'use' and learners will be expected to be thoughtful (not simply memorizing) in their selection and application of estimation techniques.

## Example activities for Unit One:

- -Read Cargo cult statistics and the scientific crisis (Stark and Saltelli, 2016) before class and in-class discussion on what students found surprising and why.
- -Groups  instructed  to  list  as  many  stakeholders  as  students  can  identify  in  the classroom and, hypothetically, in the workplace where they may use statistics.
- -Instructor led stakeholder analysis regarding the application of an estimator with desirable large sample properties in the development of a drug.

Unit Two - Statistical inference and stewardship 6 Relevant Learning Objectives: 4, 5, 6, 7, 10

- 2.1 What's in a likelihood
- 2.2 Neyman-Pearson paradigm for optimal testing
- 2.3 Trustworthy testing

## Example activities for Unit Two:

- -Read  blurb  from The  preparation  of  stewards  with  the  Mastery  Rubric  for Stewardship: Re-envisioning the formation of scholars and practitioners (Rios, Golde  &amp;  Tractenberg;  2019)  before  class  followed  by  in-class,  small  group discussion about the meaning of the phrase "steward of statistics".
- -Individual  reflection  on  what  it  means  to  be  a  steward  of  statistical  practices handed in as an ungraded assignment that will be revisited later in the semester.
- -Student groups complete an in-class worksheet identifying potential stakeholders in the application of hypothesis testing.
- -Individual  assessment  item  that  tasks  students  with  making  a  decision  from  a hypothesis test that is justified with a stakeholder analysis.

Unit Three Disciplinary best practices 7 for common study designs and analyses Relevant Learning Objectives: 8, 9, 10

- 3.1 One and two sample means
- 3.2 ANOVA
- 3.3 Categorical data
- 3.4 Linear regression

## Example activities for Unit 3:

- -Student groups assigned various principles from the American  Statistical Association's Guidelines for Ethical Statistical Practice (Ie. Principle A through H) complete a worksheet where they identify which principles specifically they think are  most  relevant  for  statistical  estimation  and  which  are  most  relevant  for inference. Followed by an instructor-led discussion where the considerations for estimation and inference are compared and contrasted.

6 The addition of ' and stewardship ' to the Unit title signals to students that the focus on inference includes stewardly consideration.

7 The addition of ' disciplinary best practices ' for common designs and analyses informs students that respect for the discipline (i.e., stewardship) is equally important for them to learn as the designs and analytic methods. The Unit title transmits the instructor's intention that students develop a stewardly, discipline- rather than results-centered, mindset.

- -In-class group activity to identify which Ethical Principles are most relevant for each  statistical  method  (i.e.two  sample  inference,  ANOVA  models,  inference about categorical data, and inference with linear regression models).
- -Individual  reflection  on  what  the  phrase  "steward  of  statistics"  means  to  each student.
- -Individual  reflection  on  students'  projected  growth  as  a  steward  of  statistical practice incorporated into end of course evaluation. (Students' are sent a copy of their anonymous responses.)

## 3.2. Notes on syllabus elements : Unit One. Motivate and contextualize

The first unit of the semester serves to both motivate and provide language for ethical reasoning  in  statistics.  The  content  is  focused  on  assuring  student  facilities  with  the prerequisite knowledge from their prior coursework in mathematics and statistics. In Week 1, students are asked to read Cargo cult statistics and the scientific crisis (Stark and Saltelli, 2016).  This  article  presents  an  approachable  argument  for  statistical  practitioners  to carefully consider potential consequences of their statistical choices, particularly on the scientific crisis and subsequent denigrations to the credibility of science generally. Students become aware of potential stakeholders though they may not yet have the language to identify them as such.

In previous academic years the syllabus has not featured mention of ethical content (such as "stewardship" and "best practice"), but now it not only is featured in the syllabus but ethics-relevant  discussions  also  begin  in  the  earliest  lectures.  The  syllabus  above communicates an intention to inculcate a sense of professional identity, ethical obligations to  respect  stakeholders,  and  the  idea  that  'even  the  mathematical  underpinnings'  of statistics  accrue  responsibilities  (e.g.  assuring  that  approximations  and  assumptions  are plausible). To optimize the chances of meeting learning objectives 9 and 10, this integration needs to begin at the earliest point in the term and carry through.

A  group  activity  over  subsequent  weeks  could  involve  asking  students  to  identify stakeholders  in  different  vignettes.  In  addition  to  recognizing  stakeholders  in  diverse contexts, students are also encouraged to identify diverse stakeholders, for example, within the classroom itself. This prompts learners to expand their perspective beyond a generic teacher-student relationship to promote the realization that their peers and maybe even the entire department are stakeholders to consider. Students can then begin to practice shifting their perspectives while they are in class. This permits exploration along many, possibly under-appreciated, lines of questioning about the statistical material which, in this unit, is primarily a mathematical introduction to estimation. In-class and homework activities are intended  to  familiarize  students  with  tools  and  their  respective  properties;  introduce considerations  of,  and  beyond,  mathematical  characteristics  in  estimation;  and  practice shifting perspectives and developing some fluency about these quantitative ideas through discussion/communication with peers.

Near the end of the unit, once the statistical reasoning and mathematical mechanics behind selecting  estimators  has  been  practiced  (in  homeworks)  and  assessed  (in  quizzes),  the instructor  presents  a  specific  vignette  in  which  to  consider  an  estimation  decision.  For example, having learned about the general conditions under which the distribution of a maximum likelihood estimator converges to a Gaussian distribution, consider the use of an asymptotic confidence interval  to estimate any moment or parameter. Any vignette can be created,  with  the  overall  intention  of  encouraging  the  realization  that  statistical  and mathematical properties of estimators are theoretically helpful, but cannot mitigate poor design or weak/incorrect understanding of population/sample.

## 3.3 Notes on syllabus element s: Unit Two. From examples to practice

Moving into the second unit, students have been introduced to the concept of stakeholders and have some familiarity with identifying, and strategically assessing, the pros and cons of statistical decisions through a stakeholder analysis. Now as they are introduced to the concept of statistical hypothesis testing, they will also spend some time continuing to build their fluency while considering specific ethical guidance, stewardly responsibilities, and stakeholder impacts that are related to inference. The steward is the individual to whom 'we can entrust the vigor, quality, and integrity of the field' (Golde &amp; Walker, 2006: p. 5), and is someone who 'will creatively generate new knowledge, critically conserve valuable and  useful  ideas,  and  responsibly  transform  those  understandings  through  writing, teaching,  and  application'  (Golde  &amp;  Walker,  2006:  p.  5).  Rios,  Golde  &amp;  Tractenberg (2019) articulated the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the disciplinary and professional steward, extending the original definition (from describing the doctorate holder in 2006) to describing  any  practitioner  in  a  field  or  discipline.  In  order  to  make  stewardship  into something that was learnable and improvable, like ethical reasoning, a unique stewardship KSA was developed '…to describe the responsibility to recognize when these behaviors need to be applied or modeled... We have called this KSA 'requisite knowledge/situational awareness'  to  capture  the  attention  that  would  be  given  to  standards  of  professional practice (if they exist) during education or training, or when orienting new employees in the  workplace.'  (Rios  et  al.  p.  11  of  27).  Understanding  the  construct  of  stewardship provides a frame of reference for the student, in terms of understanding that statistical practitioners  incur  obligations  to  stakeholders  because  the  stewardly  practitioner  is entrusted by these stakeholders to practice ethically. Outside of class, students can be asked to read sections of Rios, Golde &amp; Tractenberg (2019), for example, followed by in-class small group discussions about what the phrase "steward of statistics" means to them upon their introduction to the concept of stewardship.

Having  the  ASA  Ethical  Guidelines  (2022)  as  a  reference  reinforces  to  students  that 'statistical  practice'  is  much  more  than  simply  choosing  or  obtaining  a  data  set  and  a software program, and combining those together. There are 8 Principles and an Appendix, with a total of 72 elements. These are not valuable if they are simply memorized, so the activities of reading through the Guidelines to identify all the elements that might pertain, or that would be followed by a stewardly practitioner, can help to initiate the development of a sense of professional identity. Within the context of hypothesis testing, students learn the extent to which automated software can/can not assist in making decisions. In class, students will practice using a stakeholder analysis to explore the intricacies in formulating a hypothesis to test, in addition to assessing the fallout of various errors. Considering a simple  analysis  with  two  stakeholders,  the  statistical  practitioner  and  their  employer, groups can be assigned to assess potential harms and benefits for, say, the choice of null and alternative, the decision to focus on power or error rates, using a p-value to make a decision, or using a Bayesian posterior to make a decision.

A  group  activity  over  subsequent  weeks  is  to  engage  in  discussions,  or  include  the identification, of ASA principles that are relevant for hypothesis testing (in general), and for the selection, use, and reporting of results of hypothesis testing methods. These can be in multiple choice and short answer formats (e.g., list the Principle and specific elements that are relevant; and/or give a brief explanation about choosing one or another Principle or element). Additionally, student engagement with the stakeholder analysis can continue and become more advanced. For example, homework or in-class problems can request stakeholder  analysis  for  the  choice  of  a  hypothesis  testing  method,  or  its  use  to  make decisions or draw conclusions.

In previous academic years, the statistics course syllabi had not featured the ASA Ethical Guidelines. Instead, roughly 30 minutes of class time was dedicated to an activity that introduced  students  to  the  Ethical  Guidelines  for  Principle  B:  Integrity  of  Data  and Methods. First, the instructor presented these guidelines to the students, having a different person read each principle aloud. Then, students were given time to individually reflect on a real application of statistics which, unbeknownst to them, was an application with known ethical  violations.  During  the  reflection,  students  were  prompted  to  identify  which guidelines may have been violated and to consider what additional information they may need to determine if any ethical violations had occurred. Finally, the exercise concluded with the instructor revealing the known issues in the statistical analysis and provided some historical context as to how these issues were discovered. This activity occurred later in the semester, once students had been introduced to specific statistical methods for testing and estimation. By contrast, in the syllabus presented here, there are repeated opportunities for  students  to  revisit  the  Ethical  Guidelines  and  these  are  couched  within  a  larger framework  of  stewardship.  The  intentions  are:  a)  to  focus  student  attention  on  these features of ethical practice; b) to get students to engage with various aspects of 'statistical practice' that should be done ethically; and c) to allow students sufficient time to consider and work with the Ethical Guidelines, that can support development of the desired habits of  mind  that  have  the  strongest  likelihood  of  enduring  beyond  the  end  of  the  course. Practically speaking, at the end of the second unit, students will have begun to develop an ethically informed schema for answering questions about data with statistics. At this stage in the term, students are presented with a framework through the concept of stewardship though  they  may  not  yet  understand  how  this  concept  could  be  relevant  for  them  as potential statistical practitioners in the future.

## 3.4 Notes on syllabus elements : Unit Three. Independent and collaborative critical thinking

This semester-long course focuses on the mathematical and contextual considerations that are  critical  for  effective  statistical  practice.  The  intention  throughout  the  syllabus  and course is to emphasize that effective statistical practice is more than just the application of mathematical principles, or the use of software or execution of analysis. Instead, critical thinking is required throughout statistical practice as reflected in the learning objectives of the course. During the final third period of the term, students are regularly tasked with synthesizing  what  they  have  learned.  They  will  apply  the  knowledge  they  have accumulated regarding estimation, parameter and method selection, and the uses of this knowledge  in  testing  hypotheses  and  drawing  inference  while  also  keeping  in  mind stakeholders, the ethical practice standards of the ASA, and how these should be considered by the stewardly practitioner. The syllabus is designed so that the first two thirds of the term focuses on training students for the practice of regular, critical mathematical reasoning both independently and in collaboration with their peers. The new techniques and methods students are learning in the last third period of the term are supported by specific learning objectives which are consistently revisited during regular assessments and group activities. Moreover, homework and in-class problems involving the application of these methods can now require justification for decision making in the form of a stakeholder analysis for (any) decisions made along the way from study design, to data collection, analysis, and interpretation.  Assessments  can  also  prompt  students  to  identify  any  ASA  Ethical Guideline elements that are relevant along this same path (from design to interpretation).

As the term concludes, students are asked again to consider the importance of the stewardly practice of statistics and given the opportunity to compare their answers to their responses from earlier in the term when they were first introduced to the concept of stewardship. Finally, students can be asked to describe how they anticipate stakeholder analysis, the ASA Ethical Guidelines, and their sense of themselves as stewards to continue to grow in future courses. This simple activity can promote a commitment to ongoing engagement with ethical practice throughout their educational training and can be readily incorporated into end of semester course evaluations, for example.

In  previous  academic  years  the  introduction  of  ethical  content  was  limited  to  simply familiarizing the students with the existence of the ASA Ethical Guidelines and a single case study of an inappropriate application of statistical analysis. In the current syllabus however, the entire third unit features active integration of thinking about stakeholders, stewardship,  and  how  the  ASA  Ethical  Guidelines  can  facilitate  both.  More  than familiarization  with  disciplinary  best  practices  is  required  in  this  version  of  a  statistics course syllabus. From the first day of class when the syllabus is introduced, students are made aware that an explicit objective for their training in the course is to develop new habits of mind that are formed by consideration of stakeholders in statistical practice and a sense of professional identity based on the notion of stewardship. They are introduced to new concepts in stages that  align  with  the  presentation  of  the  typical  statistical  course material. Ethical reasoning for statistical practice is scaffolded into the course material so that it is not until after students have observed and practiced the stakeholder analysis and professional guidelines for stewardship of the discipline that they are tasked with reasoning through  any  particular  example  of  statistical  analysis  in  a  real  world  problem.  This structured  approach,  rather  than  a  one-off  detour  through  a  single  case  analysis  for example, improves the likelihood that the last two learning objectives are actually met.

## 4. Discussion and Conclusions

## 4.1 Discussion

We have outlined the rationale behind three different  approaches  to  integrating  ethical content into a primarily-quantitative course. The example course, Mathematical Statistics, is described in terms of an adaptable syllabus. The syllabus includes explicit signaling from the instructor as to the importance and role of stewardship, stakeholders, and the ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice. These three dimensions, particularly as they are integrated into the course as discussed, represent the first element of ethical reasoning: prerequisite knowledge. Just as with the mathematics and statistics content, the prerequisite knowledge  required  for  ethical  reasoning  and  ethical  statistical  practice  goes  beyond memorization. Decisions that the syllabus implicitly reflects include a focus on solely the prerequisite  knowledge  dimension  of  the  ethical  reasoning  paradigm  (Tractenberg  &amp; FitzGerald,  2012;  Tractenberg,  2022-A;  2022-B);  and  a  focus  on  the  construct  of stewardship, without moving through its set of knowledge, skills, and abilities (Rios et al. 2019). The ethical content included in this course, as described with the syllabus we have included, could be built upon in later courses with the same types of activities, but with more advanced problems or responses by students. Or, programs that use the integration described in this syllabus can choose ethical reasoning (Tractenberg &amp; FitzGerald, 2012; Tractenberg et al. 2017) or stewardship (Rios et al. 2019) as a paradigm to graft into the full curriculum.

## 4.2 Conclusions

Recent encouragement to incorporate 'ethics' into the curricula for statistics (ASA, 2014) and for data science (National Academies, 2018) has been published for undergraduate degree programs. However, resources that exist for 'teaching ethics' are not accessible for many instructors of courses that feature primarily quantitative materials and content. When discussing the best practices for teaching mathematics, Kelton (2010) notes,

'It is easy for students to have the misconception that the problems are easy when they witness you solving them with no difficulty. Giving the students a chance to see where they might stumble will help them formulate questions and motivate them  to  give  the  homework  proper  attention.  It  may  be  best  to  only  give  the students one or two problems at a time to solve on their own. That is generally sufficient  for  the  students  to  ascertain  whether  they  are  having  significant difficulty. After you have demonstrated the skill, give the class a basic problem or two to try on their own.'

Not only is this sentiment as true for reasoning and understanding ethical obligations as it is  for  teaching  mathematics, it is also appropriate for instructors who want to integrate ethics content into more mathematically-oriented courses. In their Recommendation 2.5, The Committee on Envisioning the Data Science Discipline pointed out that 'Ethics is a topic that, given the nature of data science, students should learn and practice throughout their  education.  Academic  institutions  should  ensure  that  ethics  is  woven  into  the  data science curriculum from the beginning and throughout.' (National Academies, 2018). This paper has outlined three different ways to overcome the difficulties that might prevent instructors  in  primarily  quantitative  courses  in  these  curricula  from  integrating  ethical content, ethical reasoning, or the consideration of how fundamental attributes of formulae, theorems,  and  proofs  can  support  this  integration  'from  the  beginning'  of  quantitative programs or courses. A syllabus and organizational structure is presented that can be used, adapted, or utilized in - or to seed - a sequence of courses where students are asked to generate increasingly sophisticated responses to similar questions.

## Topics outline for the semester

Unit One - Thoughtful use of 9

estimation techniques Relevant Learning Objectives: 1, 2, 3, 9

8 Two learning outcomes reflect the instructor's intention to prioritize not only the contextualization of statistical methods and theory in real world applications, but also the facts that a) statistical methods and theories have potential impacts on stakeholders; b) these impacts and stakeholders are important enough to feature at the learning outcome level (not as an aside); and c) there is more to learning the mathematical underpinnings of statistics than 'just math' stewardship, and responsibilities to the discipline, are also learnable and important to internalize.

9 The addition of ' Thoughtful use of ' to the Unit title signals to students that the focus moves beyond 'use' and learners will be expected to be thoughtful (not simply memorizing) in their selection and application of estimation techniques.

## 1.1 Review of probability

Throughout the review of probability,  the instructor will introduce a reasoning tool called a "stakeholder analysis". Students will practice naming stakeholders in various contexts and begin to understand that although assumptions and approximations always work in the theoretical  realm,  they  have  real  implications  for  practice  and  may  not  work  for  every stakeholder.

## 1.2 Methods to derive estimators

Throughout the introduction of estimation methods, the instructor will continue to feature the stakeholder analysis to explore how selection and application of estimation techniques can potentially have effects beyond simple numeric solutions.

## 1.3 Intro to large sample theory of estimation

After introducing the students to fundamental large sample results concerning maximum likelihood  estimation,  the  instructor  will  lead  an  in-class  discussion  of  a  stakeholder analysis regarding the application of an estimator with desirable large sample properties.

## 1.4 Interval estimation

Students are introduced to Bayesian and frequentist interval estimation techniques. The instructor will lead a class discussion of a stakeholder analysis focused on the implications of various choices that are made in interval estimation.

## Unit Two - Statistical inference and stewardship 10

Relevant Learning Objectives: 4, 5, 6, 7, 10

## 2.1 What's in a likelihood

As  students'  work  through  understanding  the  concept  of  a  likelihood  function  and dimension reduction through sufficient statistics, the instructor will present the notion of a steward of statistics.

## 2.2 Neyman-Pearson paradigm for optimal testing

As students' wrestle with the logic behind optimal testing, they are also becoming aware of the  restrictiveness  of  ideal  mathematical  reasoning  in  the  applied  world.  They  will  be encouraged to reference an explicit definition of stewardship as they consider how to use statistical tests in less-than-ideal conditions.

## 2.3 Trustworthy testing

As students start to understand what it means to be a steward of statistical practice, the instructor  will  reference  hypothesis  tests  as  a  concrete  example  of  why  stewardship  is important.  The  instructor  will  lead  students  to  examine  the  role  of  various  potential stakeholders in stewardly statistical inference.

## Unit Three - Disciplinary best practices for 11 common study designs and analyses

Relevant Learning Objectives: 8, 9, 10

10 The addition of ' and stewardship ' to the Unit title signals to students that the focus on inference includes stewardly consideration.

11 The addition of ' Disciplinary best practices for ' common designs and analyses informs students that respect for the discipline (i.e., stewardship) is equally important for them to learn as the designs and analytic methods. The Unit title transmits the instructor's intention that students develop a stewardly, discipline- rather than results-centered, mindset .

## 3.1 One and two sample means

The instructor will introduce the American Statistical Association's Guidelines for Ethical Statistical  Practice.  Students  will  work  in  small  discussion  groups  to  consider  why particular statistical methods are 'common' from a perspective that names and considers potential stakeholders.

## 3.2 ANOVA

The instructor  will  continue  to  reference  the  ASA's  Ethical  Guidelines  with  respect  to ANOVA

methods.  Groups will continue to attempt to characterize "common" statistical methods and will be encouraged to also consider the role of software and the level of engagement with ASA Ethical Guidelines that software encourages.

## 3.3 Categorical data

Students will be prompted to discuss the differences for stakeholders between methods that use continuous or categorical data. The instructor will emphasize what the ASA's Ethical Guidelines suggest a stewardly practitioner should prioritize when given a choice between categorical or continuous variable-based analysis.

## 3.4 Linear regression

As the semester concludes, students revisit the concept of linear regression from a more mathematically and stewardly informed perspective. In groups and as a class, students and the  instructor  will  discuss  variable  choice  and  model  selection  referencing  the  ASA's Ethical Guidelines and centering the notion of statistical stewardship.

Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice Prepared by the Committee on Professional Ethics of the American Statistical Association 31 January 2022

## PURPOSE OF THE GUIDELINES:

The  American  Statistical  Association's  Ethical  Guidelines  for  Statistical  Practice  are intended  to  help  statistical  practitioners  make  decisions  ethically.  In  these  Guidelines, 'statistical practice' includes activities such as: designing the collection of, summarizing, processing,  analyzing,  interpreting,  or  presenting,  data;  as  well  as  model  or  algorithm development and deployment. Throughout these Guidelines, the term "statistical practitioner" includes all those who engage in statistical practice, regardless of job title, profession, level, or field of degree. The Guidelines are intended for individuals, but these principles are also relevant to organizations that engage in statistical practice.

The Ethical Guidelines aim to promote accountability by informing those who rely on any aspects of statistical practice of the standards that they should expect. Society benefits from informed judgments supported by ethical statistical practice. All statistical practitioners are expected to follow these Guidelines and to encourage others to do the same.

In some situations, Guideline principles may require balancing of competing interests. If an  unexpected  ethical  challenge  arises,  the  ethical  practitioner  seeks  guidance,  not exceptions,  in  the  Guidelines.  To  justify  unethical  behaviors,  or  to  exploit  gaps  in  the Guidelines, is unprofessional, and inconsistent with these Guidelines.

## PRINCIPLE A: Professional Integrity and Accountability

Professional  integrity  and  accountability  require  taking  responsibility  for  one's  work. Ethical statistical practice supports valid and prudent decision making with appropriate methodology. The ethical statistical practitioner represents their capabilities and activities honestly, and treats others with respect.

## The ethical statistical practitioner:

1. Takes responsibility for evaluating potential tasks, assessing whether they have (or can attain) sufficient competence to execute each task, and that the work and timeline are feasible. Does not solicit or deliver work for which they are not qualified, or that they would not be willing to have peer reviewed.
2. Uses methodology and data that are valid, relevant, and appropriate, without favoritism or prejudice, and in a manner intended to produce valid, interpretable, and reproducible results.
3. Does not knowingly conduct statistical practices that exploit vulnerable populations or create or perpetuate unfair outcomes.
4. Opposes efforts to predetermine or influence the results of statistical practices, and resists pressure to selectively interpret data.
5. Accepts full responsibility for their own work; does not take credit for the work of others;  and  gives  credit  to  those  who  contribute.  Respects  and  acknowledges  the intellectual property of others.
6. Strives to follow, and encourages all collaborators to follow, an established protocol for authorship. Advocates for recognition commensurate with each person's contribution to the work. Recognizes that inclusion as an author does imply, while acknowledgement may imply, endorsement of the work.
7. Discloses conflicts of interest, financial and otherwise, and manages or resolves them according to established policies, regulations, and laws.
8. Promotes the dignity and fair treatment of all people. Neither engages in nor condones discrimination  based  on  personal  characteristics.  Respects  personal  boundaries  in interactions and avoids harassment including sexual harassment, bullying, and other abuses of power or authority.
9. Takes appropriate action when aware of deviations from these Guidelines by others.
10. Acquires and maintains competence through upgrading of skills as needed to maintain a high standard of practice.
11. Follows applicable policies, regulations, and laws relating to their professional work, unless there is a compelling ethical justification to do otherwise.
12. Upholds, respects, and promotes these Guidelines. Those who teach, train, or mentor in statistical practice have a special obligation to promote behavior that is consistent with these Guidelines.

PRINCIPLE B: Integrity of Data and Methods

The ethical statistical practitioner seeks to understand and mitigate known or suspected limitations, defects, or biases in the data or methods and communicates potential impacts on  the  interpretation,  conclusions,  recommendations,  decisions,  or  other  results  of statistical practices.

## The ethical statistical practitioner:

1. Communicates  data  sources  and  fitness  for  use,  including  data  generation  and collection processes and known biases. Discloses and manages any conflicts of interest relating  to  the  data  sources.  Communicates  data  processing  and  transformation procedures, including missing data handling.
2. Is transparent about assumptions made in the execution and interpretation of statistical practices including methods  used, limitations, possible sources of error, and algorithmic biases. Conveys results or applications of statistical practices in ways that are honest and meaningful.
3. Communicates  the  stated  purpose  and  the  intended  use  of  statistical  practices.  Is transparent regarding a priori versus post hoc objectives and planned versus unplanned statistical  practices.  Discloses  when  multiple  comparisons  are  conducted,  and  any relevant adjustments.
4. Meets obligations to share the data used in the statistical practices, for example, for peer review and replication, as allowable. Respects expectations of data contributors when  using  or  sharing  data.  Exercises  due  caution  to  protect  proprietary  and confidential data, including all data that might inappropriately harm data subjects.
5. Strives to promptly  correct substantive errors discovered after publication or implementation. As appropriate, disseminates the correction publicly and/or to others relying on the results.
6. For  models  and  algorithms  designed  to  inform  or  implement  decisions  repeatedly, develops  and/or  implements  plans  to  validate  assumptions  and  assess  performance over time, as needed. Considers criteria and mitigation plans for model or algorithm failure and retirement.
7. Explores and describes the effect of variation in human characteristics and groups on statistical practice when feasible and relevant.

## PRINCIPLE C:  Responsibilities to Stakeholders

Those who fund, contribute to, use, or are affected by statistical practices are considered stakeholders. The ethical statistical practitioner respects the interests of stakeholders while practicing in compliance with these Guidelines.

## The ethical statistical practitioner:

1. Seeks to establish what stakeholders hope to obtain from any specific project. Strives to  obtain  sufficient  subject-matter  knowledge  to  conduct  meaningful  and  relevant statistical practice.
2. Regardless  of  personal  or  institutional  interests  or  external  pressures,  does  not  use statistical practices to mislead any stakeholder.
3. Uses  practices  appropriate  to  exploratory  and  confirmatory  phases  of  a  project, differentiating findings from each so the stakeholders can understand and apply the results.
4. Informs  stakeholders  of  the  potential  limitations  on  use  and  re-use  of  statistical practices in different contexts and offers guidance and alternatives, where appropriate, about scope, cost, and precision considerations that affect the utility of the statistical practice.

6. Strives to make new methodological knowledge widely available to provide benefits to  society  at  large.  Presents  relevant  findings,  when  possible,  to  advance  public knowledge.
7. Understands and conforms to confidentiality requirements for data collection, release, and dissemination and any restrictions on its use established by the data provider (to the  extent  legally  required).  Protects  the  use  and  disclosure  of  data  accordingly. Safeguards privileged information of the employer, client, or funder.
8. Prioritizes both scientific integrity and the principles outlined in these Guidelines when interests are in conflict.

## PRINCIPLE D:  Responsibilities to Research Subjects, Data Subjects, or those directly affected by statistical practices

The ethical statistical practitioner does not misuse or condone the misuse of data. They protect  and  respect  the  rights  and  interests  of  human  and  animal  subjects.  These responsibilities extend to those who will be directly affected by statistical practices.

## The ethical statistical practitioner:

1. Keeps informed about and adheres to applicable rules, approvals, and guidelines for the protection and welfare of human and animal subjects. Knows when work requires ethical review and oversight. 12
2. Makes informed recommendations for sample size and statistical practice methodology in order to avoid the use of excessive or inadequate numbers of subjects and excessive risk to subjects

Recognizes  that  statistical  practice  could  adversely  affect  groups  or  the  public perception  of  groups,  including  marginalized  groups.  Considers  approaches  to minimize negative impacts in applications or in framing results in reporting.
7. Refrains  from  collecting  or  using  more  data  than  is  necessary.  Uses  confidential information only when permitted and only to the extent necessary. Seeks to minimize

12 Examples of ethical review and oversight include an Institutional Review Board (IRB), an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), or a compliance assessment.

- the risk of re-identification when sharing de-identified data or results where there is an expectation of confidentiality. Explains any impact of de-identification on accuracy of results.
8. To maximize contributions of data subjects, considers how best to use available data sources for exploration, training, testing, validation, or replication as needed for the application. The ethical statistical practitioner appropriately discloses how the data are used for these purposes and any limitations.
9. Knows the legal limitations on privacy and confidentiality assurances and does not over-promise or assume legal privacy and confidentiality protections where they may not apply.
10. Understands  the  provenance  of  the  data,  including  origins,  revisions,  and  any restrictions on usage, and fitness for use prior to conducting statistical practices.
11. Does not conduct statistical practice that could reasonably be interpreted by subjects as sanctioning a violation of their rights. Seeks to use statistical practices to promote the just and impartial treatment of all individuals.

## PRINCIPLE E: Responsibilities to members of multidisciplinary teams
