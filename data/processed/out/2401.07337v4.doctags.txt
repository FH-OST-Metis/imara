<text><loc_83><loc_203><loc_419><loc_298>We study efficient risk sharing among risk-averse agents in an economy with a large, finite number of states. Following a random shock to an initial agreement, agents may renegotiate. If they require a minimal utility improvement to accept a new deal, we show the probability of finding a mutually acceptable allocation vanishes exponentially as the state space grows. This holds regardless of agents' degree of risk aversion. In a two-agent multiple-priors model, we find that the potential for Pareto-improving trade requires that at least one agent's set of priors has a vanishingly small measure. Our results hinge on the 'shape does not matter' message of high-dimensional isoperimetric inequalities.</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_68><loc_443><loc_197>An economy without aggregate risk is populated by a group of risk-averse agents. The agents reach an efficient risk-sharing agreement that involves, for each of them, a state-contingent consumption plan. 1 The agreement provides a certain level of welfare. Before executing the agreement, the agents learn of a random perturbation to the economy that induces aggregate, or systemic, uncertainty. Now the group may wish to renegotiate their initial agreement, but will only do so if they can guarantee themselves a minimal welfare improvement compared to what they had before the perturbation. There are transaction costs to renegotiating that must be covered. We ask: how likely is it that the agents can achieve this improvement? Our main result is that, when the number of states is large, the existence of a welfare-improving renegotiation is extremely unlikely. Its probability decreases exponentially in the number of states.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_203><loc_443><loc_370>The diagram on the left in Figure 1 illustrates the situation, albeit in the case with two states ( d ' 2) and two agents. Aggregate consumption is fixed at 1 (say 1 million dollars) in every state, represented by the vector ω ' p 1 , 1 q . Aggregate consumption is state-independent, and thus implies no aggregate risk. The square defined by the origin and ω ' p 1 , 1 q is an Edgeworth box that describes all the allocations-all risk-sharing agreements-between the two agents. The Pareto optimal allocations are on the solid curve connecting the origin and ω , while f ' p f 1 , f 2 q is a particular Pareto optimal allocation (indicated by the tangency of the agents' indifference curves at the point f , with the usual Edgeworth-box convention that one agent's coordinate system has been rotated 180 ˝ and its origin coincides with ω ). For the allocation f , we may consider all the aggregate consumptions that can be decentralized among the two agents so as to obtain higher utility 'by ε ' than in f . 2 This set of aggregate bundles consists of all the bundles on the dotted region to the north-east of the dashed curve passing through ω (a curve that, at ω , has the same slope as the common tangent to agents' indifference curves at f ).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_375><loc_441><loc_419>The aggregate consumption p 1 , 1 q is subject to a random perturbation, an aggregate shock z . Suppose that z is symmetrically distributed around p 0 , 0 q ; in fact, uniformly distributed among all z with ‖ z ‖ ď r -for some r ą 0. Our results say that the probability that z lies in the dotted region, and thus that aggregate risk can be decentralized among the agents in</text>

<footnote><loc_59><loc_433><loc_443><loc_448>2 An improvement by ε means a state-contingent consumption g so that p 1 ´ ε q g is strictly preferred to f i . If, for example, preferences are homothetic, this translates into a utility improvement of ε {p 1 ´ ε q %.</footnote>

<text><loc_58><loc_182><loc_442><loc_228>ways that improve individual welfare by ε , is bounded above by e ´ ε 2 d { 8 r 2 . For example, when r ' 1, ε ' 0 . 1, and d is the number of securities traded on NASDAQ, this bound is about 0.67%. The point is that the probability of an agreeable renegotiation shrinks exponentially to zero as the number of states grows.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_233><loc_442><loc_327>The result is surprising because it holds regardless of the agents' attitudes towards risk. For contrast, imagine instead that agents are extremely risk averse. Any contingent consumption is evaluated according to a worst-case scenario, which is determined by the smallest payoff in any given state. The picture on the right in Figure 1 illustrates the situation. Now an aggregate shock z can only be distributed to make all agents better off if z p s q ą 0 in every state s , because if there is a state with less aggregate consumption, then some agent must consume less, and therefore be worse off, under the assumption of extreme risk aversion. The probability of such a perturbation is 1 { 2 d , which also shrinks exponentially to zero.</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_332><loc_443><loc_437>Comparing the pictures on the left and right of Figure 1 emphasizes the real message of our results. On the left, agents' limited risk aversion (the curvature of their indifference curves) leaves significant room for a welfare improvement after the shock z . When agents are close to risk-neutral, and d ' 2, the probability of a small ε improvement after the shock becomes arbitrarily close to 1 { 2. As the number of states grows large, however, the probability inexorably decreases to zero. We can even assume that the allocation f is supported by an equilibrium price vector p , and restrict attention to shocks z with p ¨ z ą 0, the shocks that have some chance of being welfare-improving. Then the probability in the left Edgeworth box (with d ' 2) is arbitrarily close to 1; while, again, as d grows, it shrinks exponentially to zero.</text>

<text><loc_73><loc_48><loc_345><loc_54>Our paper presents three results on economies with many states.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_60><loc_443><loc_141>The first result (Theorem 1) concerns a single agent's welfare. Imagine, again, a group of agents and an efficient allocation f . Suppose this time that the allocation is supported by some equilibrium prices; it is part of a Walrasian (or Arrow-Debreu) equilibrium. Given a shock z , the group looks for one agent i who is willing to absorb the shock, meaning that f i ` z provides them with a welfare improvement of at least ε over f i . The number of agents may be very large, and the group just needs one of them to take on z . The probability that there exists such an agent decreases, again, exponentially to zero with the number of states.</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_146><loc_441><loc_202>The second main result (Theorem 2) concerns an aggregate shock, and the ability to renegotiate an efficient risk-sharing agreement after the shock is realized. This is the result we have described using Figure 1. In Proposition 1, we recast this result for allocations that represent inefficient risk sharing. The degree of inefficiency is measured by Debreu's coefficient of resource utilization.</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_208><loc_443><loc_325>Our third main result (Theorem 3) is not explicitly about welfare, but instead about the attitudes towards uncertainty by agents who engage in efficient risk sharing. We consider the same setting of economic exchange with no aggregate uncertainty, as in our second result; but we strengthen the assumptions on preferences to focus on utilities with multiple priors. Think, to fix ideas, of the max-min expected utility preferences of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). Now we prove that, if the risk sharing agreement between the two agents can be improved in the Pareto sense, then at least one of the two must have a small set of prior beliefs. The stronger the level of Pareto improvement, the smaller the size of the set of prior beliefs. This means that at least one of the two agents must, in some sense, be close to being ambiguity neutral.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_331><loc_443><loc_448>The sources of our, perhaps counterintuitive, results are some equally counterintuitive phenomena in high-dimensional probability. Our results rely on the study of concentration of measures, and specifically on the implication of an isoperimetric inequality for the separation of convex sets. We explore the consequences of the 'shapes do not matter' message from the literature in probability for economics. Key is the role of ε , or of the coefficient of resource utilization, in our discussion above. These magnitudes provide a certain 'padding,' or bound, on the degree of separation of the relevant convex sets. The phenomenon of concentration of measure then has strong consequences for the volume of one of the sets being separated: one of the separated sets must have small volume. In our model, we can usually determine which of the sets must have small volume, and thus obtain the results we have described. Given its</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_118><loc_441><loc_137>Before presenting our model and main results, we lay down some of the basic definitions we shall make use of, as well as a few notational conventions.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_142><loc_441><loc_174>If S is a finite set, we denote by ∆ S ' t µ : S ÞÑ R ` | ř s P S µ p s q ' 1 u the set of all probability measures on S . We embed ∆ S as a subset of R d ` , and sometimes we refer to this probability simplex by ∆ d .</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_178><loc_441><loc_235>Let A be a subset of a finite-dimensional normed vector space p R m , ‖ ¨ ‖ q . The distance of a point x P R m from A is defined by dist p x, A q -inf a P A ‖ x ´ a ‖ . By default, the norm used in the paper is the Euclidean /lscript 2 norm. When a particular p -norm is used, we refer to the distance function by dist p , and the norm by ‖ ¨ ‖ p . For the /lscript 2 norm, we usually omit the subscript 2.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_241><loc_441><loc_273>We represent the Euclidean open ball centered at c and with radius r by B p c, r q -t x P R d : ‖ x ´ c ‖ ă r u . When the center is omitted, we take it to be the null vector 0 . When the radius is omitted, we assume it is r ' 1. Thus B denotes the standard (open) unit ball.</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_277><loc_441><loc_321>We denote the uniform probability law on B p r q by P r . We further define the class of (Borel) probability measures supported on B p r q that are absolutely continuous with respect to P r , with their Radon-Nikodym derivative almost everywhere bounded above by a constant κ , as follows:</text>
<formula><loc_139><loc_322><loc_361><loc_340>\mathcal { M } _ { \kappa } ^ { r } \coloneqq \left \{ P _ { \kappa } ^ { r } \in \Delta \left ( \mathbb { B } ( r ) \right ) \colon \frac { \text {d} P _ { \kappa } ^ { r } } { \text {d} P ^ { r } } ( z ) \leqslant \kappa , \ a . e . \ z \in \mathbb { B } ( r ) \right \} \, .</formula>
<text><loc_59><loc_346><loc_441><loc_378>For example, the d -dimensional standard Gaussian measure restricted to the r -ball has a bounded Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to P r , with the constant κ ď e r 2 { 2 (see Section 6.1).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_382><loc_443><loc_403>For two subsets A, B Ď R m , we define dist p A, B q -inf t ‖ a ´ b ‖ : a P A, b P B u . We refer to the δ -extension of the subset A by A δ ' t x : dist p x, A q ă δ u , which coincides with A ` δ B .</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_407><loc_443><loc_452>Given a measurable subset A Ď R m , we denote its Euclidean volume by Vol p A q , which is equal to the Lebesgue integral of the indicator function of A relative to the affine hull of A . For example, if A is a p m ´ 1 q -dimensional surface in R m , then Vol p A q refers to the surface area of A , as opposed to its m -dimensional volume (which is zero).</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_64><loc_443><loc_84>We consider a setting with uncertainty. 3 Let S be a finite set of possible states of the world , and d be the number of states of the world; d -| S | .</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_90><loc_441><loc_121>Consequences are evaluated based on their monetary payoff in R . The set of acts , mappings from S Ñ R , is denoted by R d , and individual acts are denoted by f and g . We endow this set with its natural topology.</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_126><loc_441><loc_158>Let ľ be a binary relation on R d . As usual, we denote the strict part of ľ by ą , and the associated indifference relation by ' . We say that ľ is a (weakly monotone) preference relation if it satisfies the following properties:</text>

<list_item><loc_73><loc_187><loc_440><loc_207>(Continuity): The upper and lower contour sets are closed. That is, for every f P R d , the sets t g : g ľ f u and t g : f ľ g u are closed subsets of R d</list_item>

</unordered_list>
<text><loc_58><loc_247><loc_443><loc_292>The space of such preference relations on R d is denoted by P . We say that ľ is a strongly monotonic preference relation if, in addition to the weak order and continuity properties, it satisfies strong monotonicity: Namely, for all f, g P R d if f p s q ě g p s q for all s P S and f ‰ g , then f ą g . We denote the space of strongly monotone preferences by P sm Ă P .</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_297><loc_441><loc_366>Given a preference ľ and an act f , the set t g : g ľ f u is called the upper contour set of ľ at f . We say that a preference ľ is convex if its upper contour sets are convex, for all acts f . Convexity jointly with the weak order property and continuity imply that the strict upper contour set, denoted by U p 0 q ľ -t g : g ą f u , is also convex. We refer to the space of convex preferences by C Ă P . We interpret convexity in our model as a basic property of risk, or uncertainty aversion (Yaari, 1969).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_371><loc_442><loc_427>Many well-known models in the theory of choice under uncertainty are special cases of convex preferences. Examples are risk-averse subjective expected utility (SEU), max-min expected utility (MEU: see Gilboa and Schmeidler, 1989), multiplier preferences (Hansen and Sargent, 2001), variational preferences (Maccheroni et al., 2006), and smooth ambiguity aversion (Klibanoff et al., 2005).</text>
<footnote><loc_59><loc_434><loc_441><loc_456>3 Using the reinterpretation of commodities in Debreu (1959), our results have implications for many other economic environments. For example, for the textbook version of the model which assumes that consumption is in units of physically distinct goods.</footnote>

<text><loc_73><loc_48><loc_398><loc_54>An approximate, or robust, notion of upper contour sets is key to our results.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_66><loc_441><loc_86>Definition 1 ( ε -upper contour set) . The ε -approximate upper contour set of the preference ľ at the act f is defined by</text>
<formula><loc_179><loc_99><loc_321><loc_109>\mathcal { U } _ { \geq } ^ { ( \varepsilon ) } ( f ) = \left \{ g \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d } \colon ( 1 - \varepsilon ) g > f \right \} \, .</formula>
<text><loc_59><loc_122><loc_442><loc_155>When ľ is continuous and convex, the approximate upper contour set U p ε q ľ p f q is convex and open. Convexity is often of particular importance to us, as some of our arguments rely on a hyperplane separation theorem.</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_161><loc_441><loc_242>Approximate optimality is often expressed by means of the ε -maximization of some numerical objective function-a utility function u representing a preference ľ . Observe that when ľ is homothetic (which is the case for many preferences used in applications), then u may be taken to be homogeneous of degree one. As a consequence, our notion of approximate optimality translates directly into an approximation of utilities. Indeed, we may then write U p ε q ľ p f q ' ␣ g P R d : p 1 ´ ε q u p g q ą u p f q ( . Then an act g is in U p ε q ľ p f q if and only if it represents an ε {p 1 ´ ε q % utility improvement over f .</text>

We go back and forth between the textbook 'allocation' terminology, and 'risk-sharing agreement,' given our interpretation of consumption as a state-contingent monetary act. 4</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_48><loc_442><loc_116>In words, an allocation f is ε -Pareto optimal if there is no redistribution of the aggregate endowment ω ' ř i f i that would be strictly better for all agents, and that would remain strictly better for all agents after a fraction ε of consumption is 'shaved off' in each state of the world. When ε ' 0, the definition coincides with the usual notion of weak Pareto optimality . When we insist on the risk-sharing interpretation of our model, Pareto optimality means an ex-ante efficient risk-sharing agreement.</text>

Convexity is required for the basic theory of general equilibrium: existence of Walrasian equilibrium, as well as the second welfare theorem, relies on convex preferences. Our Theorems 2 and 3 will also rely on the convexity of agents' preferences (Theorem 1 however, makes no such assumption, but it is a statement about Walrasian equilibrium allocations).</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_339><loc_443><loc_383>To unpack the statement of Theorem 1, imagine an economy with two consumers, I ' t 1 , 2 u .

<footnote><loc_59><loc_405><loc_441><loc_451>6 One simple intuition highlights the connection with the concentration of measures: Consider an economy with a single risk-neutral agent, and assume that all states are equally likely; so the agent's preferences are represented by u p f q ' ř s f p s q . Then an ε -improvement over a constant act f p s q ' 1 (which would be an equilibrium allocation in a Robinson Crusoe economy) requires that p 1 ´ ε q ř s z p s q ą εd , or that 1 d ř s z p s q ą ε {p 1 ´ ε q . In high dimensions, despite the lack of independence ( z is drawn from a sphere), the random variable 1 d ř s z p s q is tightly concentrated around 0.</footnote>

The agent's indifference curve, tangent to the budget line at f i , is depicted as a dashed curve. The upper contour set is the region to the northeast of the indifference curve that contains all consumptions that are preferred to f i . If a random perturbation z P B p r q is in p U p ε q 1 p f 1 q´ f 1 uqYp U p ε q 2 p f 2 q´t f 2 uq , then it means that either p 1 ´ ε qp z ` f 1 q provides a strict welfare improvement for agent 1 over f 1 , or that p 1 ´ ε qp z ` f 2 q does this for agent 2 over f 2 (or that both things are true).</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_134><loc_443><loc_251>The consumer would be better off with more consumption in every state, but they would also be willing to accept a tradeoff of more consumption in one state than in another. Of course, the tradeoffs would have to be at terms of trade that are more favorable than equilibrium prices, and guided by the curvature of the agent's utility function (and its implied level of risk aversion). But the figure shows that there is a significant probability that a perturbation would leave the agent strictly better off, and the upper contour set contains much more than the bundles that are larger state-by-state. So does the dotted region. The theorem, actually, deals with the event that z is in p U p ε q 1 p f 1 q´ f 1 uqYp U p ε q 2 p f 2 q´t f 2 uq , a potentially non-convex set that is usually strictly larger than the dotted region (and even larger when there are more than two agents).</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_257><loc_442><loc_350>The implications of the theorem may, therefore, be surprising for reasons that are familiar from our discussion in the introduction. The perturbations z with p 1 ´ ε qp f i ` z q ą i f i do not all feature z ą 0. In fact, the figure, as well as basic economic intuition, suggests that the curvature of the agents' utility functions should matter in calculating the probability in Theorem 1. So it is surprising that, for large d , the curvature, or risk attitude, does not matter and we get an exponentially decreasing probability of a welfare improvement; the same as we would get if we were dealing with extremely risk-averse agents, and asking for a perturbation that is positive in all dimensions.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_356><loc_441><loc_424>To put the bound in the theorem in context, consider an example with τ ' r , a uniform probability measure, and a 11% welfare improvement ( ε ' 0 . 1).

Financial economists often take the state space to equal the returns to a set of assets that are traded in the market: Hence, if we take d to be the number of stocks, say, trading on the NASDAQ Exchange, then our bound from Theorem 1 is about 0.67%. 7</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_245><loc_441><loc_325>It is also worth emphasizing that, just like in Theorem 1, the basic message of Theorem 2 holds, even if we restrict attention to perturbations that result in a more expensive aggregate bundle. So, if p is the supporting price vector obtained from the second welfare theorem, we can restrict to perturbations z with p ¨ z ą 0. These are the perturbations that, according to neoclassical cost-benefit analysis (or the Kaldor criterion, see Graaff (1967)), have some chance of being Pareto improving. The reason is the same as that previously discussed for Theorem 1.</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_331><loc_443><loc_401>A version of Theorem 2 holds for allocations that are not Pareto optimal. We make use of the measure of inefficiency introduced by Debreu (1951), the coefficient of resource utilization .

This means that there is an alternative allocation of the aggregate endowment in E that makes all agents strictly better off.

Debreu (1951) shows that CRU p f q is well defined (in particular, that it does not depend on the selection of prices p p ω ˚ q ), that it is a number in p 0 , 1 s , and that CRU p f q ă 1 when f is Pareto dominated.</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_295><loc_443><loc_401>Proposition 1 quantifies the meaning of the coefficient of resource utilization.

But in an economy with a large state space, even a seemingly large amount of inefficiency-as measured by the coefficient of resource utilization-may not translate into a wide scope for welfare improvements by changing aggregate consumption. To use a similar numerical example from before, consider the case where d is calculated from the number of stocks listed on NASDAQ. Suppose an inefficiency of 10%, meaning a CRU of 0.9. Then the welfare improvement in Proposition 1 is about 19% and the bound on the probability of such an improvement is about 0.21%.</text>

Here we instead follow Yaari (1969) to interpret a vector that supports the upper contour sets, at some contingent consumption, as a prior belief. We depend on a relaxation of the equivalence between the existence of a common prior and Pareto efficiency of an allocation. This equivalence has been studied in a number of previous works (e.g., Billot et al., 2000; Ng, 2003; Rigotti et al., 2008; Gilboa et al., 2014; Ghirardato and Siniscalchi, 2018).

<text><loc_58><loc_167><loc_441><loc_248>In this section we study the behavioral implications of Theorem 3. For the purposes of this discussion, we consider a setting with two agents. The message of our theorem is that, if the current risk-sharing arrangement between the two agents is strongly Pareto dominated (namely if there exists a possibility of a strongly welfare improving ex-ante trade), then the volume of the underlying belief set of at least one agent must be very small. The smaller this volume is, the closer that agent is to being ambiguity neutral-a connection we seek to quantify in this section. 8</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_253><loc_441><loc_297>It is well known that ambiguity aversion leads to less trade (see, for example, Dow and da Costa Werlang (1992)). Theorem 3 offers a quantitative expression of this fact: that the possibility of an ε -Pareto improving trade necessitates small ambiguity aversion in high dimensions.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_302><loc_441><loc_358>Our interpretation of the size of a set of priors is in line with the comparative notion of ambiguity aversion proposed by Ghirardato et al. (2004).

<text><loc_59><loc_364><loc_441><loc_408>To establish the connection between ambiguity aversion and the volume of the decision maker's set of beliefs, or priors, we again appeal to the max-min expected utility setting of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989).

<text><loc_59><loc_122><loc_441><loc_141>One may define the level of ambiguity aversion by the difference between the maximum and minimum expected utility of a normalized act f (i.e., ‖ f ‖ 2 ' 1) over Π, namely</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_362><loc_441><loc_442>The presence of ε in a welfare improvement can be justified by appealing to robustness or transaction costs. When we talk about renegotiation, it is natural to imagine that reaching an agreement, with the requisite (unmodeled) communication requirements, is costly and is only worthwhile if the agents can obtain an improvement by some given margin. The number ε ą 0 captures such transaction costs. Alternatively, we may restrict attention to some robust optimization criterion, which demands a minimum utility gain before moving away from a status quo.</text>

<page_break>
<text><loc_58><loc_48><loc_442><loc_116>of states d , and the fraction ε accounted for in a utility improvement. When d is large while ε remains constant, the probabilities discussed in Theorems 1 and 2, and the volume in Theorem 3, shrink to zero. So one could question our interpretation by arguing that we should use a small value of ε when the number of states d is large. In particular, one might argue that we should impose that ε ' O p 1 { ? d q . We would disagree, however, essentially because we think of ε as a dimension-free fraction.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_122><loc_442><loc_227>First, ε is expressed as a fraction of physical units of stage-contingent consumption. If we think that f p s q , for an act f , is a monetary payment, then ε is a percentage of a monetary payment. It seems odd to impose a smaller percentage in monetary terms when the number of states is large than when it is small. For example, if we identify states with the number of assets in a market: is the meaning of a 5% return different in a market with many assets than in a market with few assets? If we instead consider ‖ ω ‖ to be a measure of the 'size' of the economy, then we may want to impose a value of ε that represents a constant fraction of ‖ ω ‖ . For example, with the assumption that ω ' 1 we have ‖ ω ‖ ' ? d . Of course, the resulting ε would then grow with d , and only strengthen our results.</text>
<text><loc_175><loc_227><loc_183><loc_233>?</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_232><loc_443><loc_350>Second, taking ε ' O p 1 { d q is problematic because it seems very hard to reconcile with the common practice of using a numerical objective function in calculating approximately optimal outcomes. As we discussed above, many applications make use of a homothetic preference and a resulting utility function that is homogeneous. Examples include the maxmin representation in choice under uncertainty, or the Cobb-Douglas utility in consumer choice. In this case, the ε equals that tolerance level assumed in the agents' maximization problem: the number ε is then measured in 'utils,' the same unit of account used for the utility function. Utils are, however, dimension-free: for example, if u is a Cobb-Douglas utility, then u p 1 q ' 1 regardless of d . In a model with many states of the world, we would hardly be allowing for any relaxation in our notion of approximate optimality.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_356><loc_441><loc_399>Finally, we should emphasize the reinterpretation of our results using the coefficient of resource utilization (see Proposition 1). The CRU is usually thought of as a fraction of national income, also a dimension-free measure, and one that might be expected to be constant, or even grow, with the size of the economy.</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_68><loc_443><loc_197>At a high level, the primary concept underpinning our results is the concentration of measure phenomenon. Every economist is familiar with the idea that, with a large sample, some sample statistics (such as the mean) are with high probability close to their population counterparts. In Euclidean spaces, dimension can play the role of sample size: in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and under relatively mild conditions, probability measures tend to concentrate as well. Specifically, for a probability measure µ on a bounded set K Ď R d , and a subset A that encompasses at least half of the probability space, namely µ p A q ě 1 { 2, the metric extension A δ ' t z : dist p z, A q ă δ u covers a substantial and growing portion of the measure µ p K q . In particular, the complement 1 ´ µ p A δ q diminishes rapidly, often exhibiting exponential decay with respect to the dimension d . These types of concentration bounds are commonly referred to as isoperimetric inequalities .</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_203><loc_443><loc_271>The importance of high-dimensional isoperimetric inequalities for our work lies in the independence of the concentration rate from the subset A . Using the words we introduced earlier in the paper: shapes do not matter. The source of our results-that certain welfare improvements have a vanishingly small probability, independent of the shape of the agents' preferences-can be traced to basic observations in the theory of isoperimetric inequalities and concentration of measures.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_277><loc_441><loc_308>A consequence of the geometric concentration of measure is that, if two subsets A and B are separated with a positive distance, then as the dimension d grows, the measure of at least one of them must be exponentially small. We apply this idea in the proofs of our results.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_314><loc_441><loc_357>In this section, we begin by introducing the core inequality that relates to the concentration of measures: the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. Then, we apply a variant of this inequality to prove Theorems 1 and 2. Once we have shown these results, we present the preliminaries of isoperimetric inequalities, and employ them to prove Theorem 3.</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_93><loc_441><loc_149>If one makes the additional assumption that A and B are restricted to convex subsets, then the inequality binds if and only if A and B are homothetic (that is, one is the translated and scaled version of the other).

In particular, for λ P r 0 , 1 s , inequality (5.1) implies that</text>

<text><loc_58><loc_229><loc_443><loc_273>We henceforth refer to this inequality as the BM inequality.

<text><loc_58><loc_182><loc_443><loc_263>We proceed with the proof of our first two theorems. In both cases, using the optimality or the equilibrium property of the allocation, we apply a type of convex separation argument.

Consequently, as we argue below, the approximate versions of upper contour sets stay at a positive distance from their separating counterpart. An application of Lemma 1 to appropriately chosen subsets implies the probability bounds in Theorems 1 and 2.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_267><loc_441><loc_287>We begin by laying down some terminology. For a vector p P R d and a constant b , we define two half-spaces:</text>
