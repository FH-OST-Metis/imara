<text><loc_126><loc_233><loc_373><loc_394>Chemical reaction networks (CRN) comprise an important class of models to understand biological functions such as cellular information processing, the robustness and control of metabolic pathways, circadian rhythms, and many more. However, any CRN describing a certain function does not act in isolation but is a part of a much larger network and as such is constantly subject to external changes. In [Shinar, Alon, and Feinberg. 'Sensitivity and robustness in chemical reaction networks.' SIAM J App Math (2009): 977-998.], the responses of CRN to changes in the linear conserved quantities, called sensitivities, were studied in and the question of how to construct absolute, i.e., basis-independent, sensitivities was raised. In this article, by applying information geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to track how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes of all concentrations within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix of absolute sensitivities. As the main technical tool, a multivariate CramerRao bound for CRN is proven, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic steady states and the exponential family of probability distributions. This leads to a linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of absolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN. As an example, the core module of the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system is analyzed analytically and numerically by extensive random sampling of the concentration space. The experimentally known findings for the robustness of the IDH enzyme are confirmed and a hidden symmetry at the level of distributions is revealed, providing a blueprint for the analysis of the robustness properties of CRNs.</text>

<section_header_level_1><loc_105><loc_75><loc_200><loc_82>1 Introduction</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_105><loc_90><loc_394><loc_123>The theory of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is an indispensable tool for the understanding of biochemical phenomena. Models based on CRN have successfully been employed to gain insights into various biological functions such as cell signaling pathways [20, 46], circadian clocks [18, 21], proofreading kinetics [25, 6], and many more [41, 2].</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_125><loc_394><loc_208>The thorough mathematical basis of chemical reaction theory has enabled much of its continuous success in applications. Originating in the fundamental work of Horn, Jackson, and Feinberg [27, 13, 26, 15], modern CRN theory uses the theory of differential equations [14, 42], algebraic geometry [8, 28, 10], graph theory [9, 12], homological algebra [24], and, in the recent years, information geometry. By realizing that the vector of chemical concentration is a distribution on a finite set, it was possible to adapt techniques from information theory and statistics to CRN theory [56, 54, 35]. In particular, the equilibrium and quasi-thermostatic steady state manifolds have the same mathematical shape as exponential families from information geometry [4, 36]. This approach has improved the geometrical understanding of growing systems [53], thermodynamic uncertainty relations and speed limits [39], and finite time driving [38].</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_210><loc_394><loc_279>To be more precise, the stoichiometric polytopes of a CRN should be thought of as analogues of a probability simplex: A concentration vector has linear quantities which are conserved by the internal CRN dynamics, analogous to the conservation of probability. However, the linear conserved quantities of a CRN can be controlled and externally changed. From the mathematical point of view, this gives the concentration space two distinguished directions: The direction of internal dynamics within stiochiometric polytopes and the complementary direction which shifts the polytopes. The main technical contribution of this article is to construct a Cramer-Rao bound for quasi-thermostatic CRNs which is adapted to detect changes in the latter direction.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_281><loc_394><loc_393>In CRN theory, the influence of an infinitesimal change of the linear conserved quantities on the steady state concentrations is known as sensitivity analysis [49]. The understanding of sensitivity is a prerequisite for the understanding of concentration robustness [7, 3, 5], absolute concentration robustness [50], perfect adaptation [22, 34], and for chemical switches [1, 55, 48]. Sensitivity has been extensively analyzed in the literature [51, 49, 52, 50, 43, 17, 44, 24, 29, 40, 30, 10, 23, 31, 47], yet, the problem remains that the sensitivity matrix is not an object that is intrinsic to the CRN but depends on the choice of a basis of Ker[ S T ] (where S is the stoichiometric matrix of the CRN). This means that the respective numerical values of the sensitivity matrix elements have no immediate physical meaning as, for example, arbitrary scaling of the basis vectors of Ker[ S T ] will lead to arbitrary scaling of the respective elements. In this article, basis independent quantities, termed absolute sensitivities , are defined and analyzed. The definition is given for any steady state manifold whenever locally there is a continuously differentiable parametrization of the manifold by the vector of conserved quantities.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_395><loc_394><loc_429>The idea behind the definition of absolute sensitivity is as follows: If, at a steady state, the concentration of a chemical X i is perturbed by an amount of δx i , a new steady state is adopted by the CRN. Thereby, the perturbation δx i distributes to concentration changes of all chemicals, prescribed by the coupling through the linear conserved quantities. The absolute sensitivity α i → j of the</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_77><loc_394><loc_210>chemical X j with respect to the chemical X i quantifies the fraction of infinitesimal concentration change of X j after this redistribution, i.e., the concentration change of the chemical X j is given by α i → j δx i , to first order in δx i . In particular, the diagonal terms α i := α i → i quantify the fraction of concentration that remains with the chemicals X i in the shifted steady sate. The independence of the choice of basis of Ker[ S T ] for the absolute sensitivities is not only aesthetically pleasing but has immediate consequences for the analysis of concentration robustness, negative feedback, and (hyper)sensitivity: In this article, it is proven that α i ∈ [0 , 1] holds for quasi-thermostatic CRN. However, for systems with non-ideal thermodynamics, α i < 0 and α i > 1 can occur, corresponding to selfregulation and hypersensitivity, respectively. Moreover, absolute concentration robustness poses very strict conditions on the CRN model, for example it is not compatible with the complex balancing condition [50] By employing the concept of absolute sensitivity, it is possible to find weaker and therefore more practically feasible notions of concentration robustness. It might often be of biological interest that the concentration of a certain chemical X i is insensitive to concentration changes of a particular chemical X j , which is captured by the vanishing of α j → i . In contrast, absolute concentration robustness in X i requires the α j → i to vanish for all i .</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_211><loc_394><loc_288>A second remarkable feature of absolute sensitivities, in addition to the independence of the Ker[ S T ] basis, is that they do not explicitly depend on kinetic parameters 1 . This leads to efficient procedures for sampling the space of physiologically feasible concentration vectors and to obtain resulting distributions of absolute sensitivities which allow to infer general robustness properties of each of the chemicals. The linear algebraic formalism developed in this article allows for computationally efficient implementations as is illustrated by using the core module of the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system as an example. Moreover, the approach reveals a surprising symmetry at the level of distributions which is not presents at the level of individual concentration vectors.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_290><loc_394><loc_352>It is worth mentioning that quantities related to absolute sensitivities have been defined in the past: In [16], Feliu has introduced sign-sensitivities for CRNs to analyze whether the steady state concentrations of X i increases or decreases when the concentration of X j is perturbed. In other words, Feliu has analyzed the signs of the α j → i . However, the work was done from the point of view of computational algebraic geometry and therefore the information geometrical interpretation of the α j → i as well as the exact formulae in the case of complex balanced systems, as derived in this paper, were not accessible in the previous work.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_353><loc_394><loc_408>The article is structured as follows: This introductory section contains a paragraph introducing the mathematical notation and then provides a summary of the main results. The terminology for CRN is introduced in Section 2. The absolute sensitivity is defined in Section 3 and its basic properties, including the basis independence, are proven. In general, a CRN does not allow for an explicit parametrization of the steady state manifold by the conserved quantities and thus no explicit expressions for the absolute sensitivities exist. However, quasi-thermostatic steady state manifolds can be analyzed with the information</text>

The steady state manifold V ss is the zero locus for the deterministic CRN dynamics d x d t = Sj with flux vector j . Let U be a n × q matrix of a complete set of basis vectors u 1 , . . . , u q for Ker[ S T ] which yields the vector of linear conserved quantities corresponding to the point x ∈ X as η = ( η 1 , . . . , η q ) T = U T x . It is assumed that there is a map β which parameterizes the steady state manifold by the vector of conserved quantities as x = β ( η ) ∈ V ss (in other words, β is a section of the map U T : X → R q with Im[ β ] ⊂ V ss ). The sensitivity at a point x ∈ V ss is given by the matrix χ with elements χ ij = ∂x i ∂η j , which is the Jacobian of the map β . These basic concepts are introduced in Section 2.</text>

The numerical values χ ij , however, depend on the choice of a basis for Ker[ S T ] and are not absolute physical quantities. It is the main purpose of this article to define sensitivities which are independent of choice of basis and study their properties. The definition is given in the next section for the most general case which requires a locally differentiable parametrization of V ss by the conserved quantities but makes no further assumptions. For quasi-thermostatic CRN more explicit results are available. They are presented in Section 4.</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_204><loc_394><loc_260>Absolute sensitivities are local quantities at a point x ∈ V ss ⊂ X which measure the sensitivity of the steady state concentrations x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n with respect to infinitesimal concentration changes of the chemicals. The definition requires that locally at x , the map U T : X → H has a continuously differentiable inverse with image in V ss . If this is not the case, absolute sensitivities are not well-defined and one needs to restrict the parameter space H accordingly. This happens, for example, at bifurcation points. Therefore, let ˜ H ⊂ H be a submanifold of H such that there is a differentiable section</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_280><loc_394><loc_336>to U T : X → H which satisfies Im[ β ] ⊂ V ss and is a local inverse to U T : V ss → H . For example, if x is a nondegenerate steady state, the existence of the section follows from the implicit function theorem. Moreover, it is well-known to exist on all of H for quasi-thermostatic steady states, cf. Section 4.2. This implies that β ( η ) must be a point in the intersection P ( η ) ∩ V ss and the requirement for β to be a local inverse amounts to requiring that β ( η ) is an isolated point in P ( η ) ∩V ss . This is illustrated in Fig. 2. The sensitivity matrix χ defined in Eq. (2) is the Jacobian of this map</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_357><loc_394><loc_426>With this setup, the absolute sensitivity of a chemical can be described as follows: If, at a steady state x ∈ V ss , the concentration of a single chemical X i is perturbed by an amount of δx i , a new steady state is adopted by the CRN. Thereby, the perturbation δx i distributes to concentration changes of all chemicals, prescribed by the coupling through the conserved quantities. The absolute sensitivity α i quantifies the fraction of concentration change that remains with X i after this redistribution, i.e. the concentration change of X i is given by α i δx i , to first order in δx i . Analogously, the absolute cross-sensitivity α i → j quantifies the resulting changes of the concentration of the chemical X j as α i → j δx i , to first order in δx i .</text>

The map U T : X → H gives a fibration of X by stoichiometric polytopes (indicated by dotted lines) with base H . The differentiable parametrization of V ss by the vectors of conserved quantities requires that the map U T : V ss → H is locally invertible with a differentiable inverse. The latter condition is not satisfied at, e.g., bifurcation points ( η ′ in the figure) and such points have to be excluded by restricting the parameter space ˜ H := H \ { η ′ } accordingly. If V ss has multiple intersection points with a stoichiometric polytope P ( η ′′ ), then there are different possible sections β which amount to choosing one of the respective branches of V ss .</caption></chart>

<text><loc_105><loc_105><loc_394><loc_176>Remark 2. More geometrically, the expansion in (3) can be reformulated as follows: It is natural to consider ∆ x and ∆ η as elements of the tangent spaces T x X and T η H . The tangent vector ∆ η pulls back to the tangent vector D η β (∆ η ) ∈ T x V ss . The vector D η β (∆ η ) is the unique vector which induces the same change in the vector of conserved quantities as ∆ x and which is, at the same time, tangent to V ss (the uniqueness of this tangent vector follows from the fact that β is a section to U T , i.e., U T ◦ β = id H , therefore U T D η β = I q and thus the Jacobian D η β is injective). Its j th component is given by [ D η β (∆ η )] j = α i → j δx i . For δx i = 1 , one obtains ∆ x = e i and recovers the expression α i → j = [ D η β ( U T e i )] j = ( χU T ) ji</text>
<text><loc_117><loc_180><loc_321><loc_185>The absolute sensitivities have the following properties:</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_190><loc_394><loc_202>Theorem 1. The matrix of absolute sensitivities A is independent of the choice of a basis of Ker[ S T ] . Moreover, the equality</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_303><loc_394><loc_318>The second claim is verified by differentiating Eq. (1), i.e., η j = ∑ n i =1 u ij x i , with respect to η j and summung over all j :</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_357><loc_394><loc_370>The equality Tr[ A ] = q shows that for any CRN, there is a balance between low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity chemicals.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_375><loc_394><loc_430>Remark 3. The basis independence of A can also be seen from the geometry discussed in Remark 2 without any calculations: The tangent vector D η β ( U T e i ) is the unique vector tangent to V ss which satisfies D η β ( U T e i ) -e i ∈ Ker[ U T ] . Now the decomposition R n ∼ = Ker[ S T ] ⊕ Im[ S ] ∼ = Im[ U ] ⊕ Ker[ U T ] together with Im[ U ] ∼ = Ker[ S T ] implies that Ker[ U T ] ∼ = Im[ S ] . Thus the characterization of the tangent vector D η β ( U T e i ) can be written as D η β ( U T e i ) -e i ∈ Im[ S ] which shows that the geometrical construction is independent of the particular choice of U .</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_117><loc_394><loc_201>The analogy between a concentration vector x ∈ R n > 0 as a distribution on the n -point set and a probability distribution is the core reason for the applicability of statistical and information geometric methods to CRN theory. Thereby, the steady state manifold of a quasi-thermostatic CRN is analogous to the exponential family of probability distributions and thus the formulation of a Cramer-Rao bound for quasi-thermostatic CRN is natural. In the bound derived here, the Jacobian of the coordinate change from η to λ coordinates serves as a Fisher information metric and the matrix U is treated as the bias of an estimator. With these ingredients, the Cramer-Rao bound for CRN is derived in Theorem 2. The lower bound is closely related to the matrix of absolute sensitivities and a tightening of the bound leads to a linear algebraic characterization of the absolute sensitivities in Lemma 1 and Theorem 3.</text>

This happens, for example, when x 4 ≫ x 1 ≈ x 2 ≈ x 3 ≈ x 5 .</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_306><loc_394><loc_347>Sampling the whole concentration space To illustrate the capabilities of the absolute sensitivity concept, we have performed numerical tests with the CRN (18). The absolute sensitivities α i for all five chemicals of the CRN were computed at random points x ∈ X in the range physiologically realistic concentrations, i.e., by uniform sampling of log x i ∈ [ -5 , 0]. The computation of the α i was performed based on the formula (9):</text>
<formula><loc_176><loc_353><loc_322><loc_361>\alpha _ { i } = \left [ \text {diag} ( x ) U \cdot [ U ^ { T } \text {diag} ( x ) U ] ^ { - 1 } U ^ { T } \right ] _ { i i } .</formula>
<text><loc_105><loc_367><loc_394><loc_408>Figure 4 shows the resulting distributions of the α i for 1.000.000 trials. The mean values and the standard deviations are recorded in Table 1. The results are rather surprising: The IDH enzyme I and its phosphorylated form I p have the same values of absolute sensitivity: α 2 , α 4 ≈ 0 . 295. Moreover, the distributions of α 2 and α 4 are very similarly shaped, with a clearly visible bias towards low values and with a decreasing number of occurrences towards higher values.</text>
<footnote><loc_105><loc_413><loc_394><loc_431>4 Note that the CRN has deficiency 1 and therefore the locus of rate constants for which the CRN is complex balanced is of codimension 1 in the space of all rate constants [8]. In this particular case, the condition on the rate constants is k + 1 k + 2 k + 3 k + 4 = k -1 k -2 k -3 k -4 .</footnote>

<text><loc_105><loc_232><loc_394><loc_294>In contrast, the bifunctional enzyme E and its complex EI p I with two IDH enzymes have rather high absolute sensitivity values: α 1 , α 5 ≈ 0 . 514. Again, the distributions of α 1 and α 5 look almost identical. This suggest a symmetry in the CRN with respect to sensitivity which is not immediately visible from the reaction scheme (18) - in particular E and EI p I do not exhibit any obvious symmetry relation. Notice that for a fixed concentration vector x , the relations α 2 = α 4 and α 1 = α 5 certainly do not hold true, cf. some sample results in Section S3.2. Hence, the symmetry appears at the level of distributions. These findings warrant further investigation in the future.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_296><loc_394><loc_343>This example shows that absolute sensitivity can be easily computed numerically by using the linear algebraic characterization derived in this article, and how the concentration space can be sampled to get an intuition for the general sensitivity properties of the CRN.

<text><loc_105><loc_245><loc_394><loc_350>The central technical contribution of this article is the derivation of the multivariate Cramer-Rao bound, as presented in Section 4. Here, it has been derived by using linear algebra. However, the natural setting for it is the recently developed information geometry for CRN [56, 36, 54, 35, 38]. The information geometry of CRN is motivated by and can be seen as an analytic extension of the global algebro-geometric viewpoint of CRN theory [11, 8, 19, 28]. There, the Cramer-Rao bound is obtained through the comparison of two Riemannian metrics. One of the metrics is given by the Hessian of a strictly convex function on the space X and the second one is its restriction to V ss ⊂ X , hence the inequality. Several properties that seem like coincidences in the setup of this article turn out to be valid in the Hessian geometric setup: The metric diag ( 1 x ) generalizes to a metric g given by the Hessian of a strictly convex function on the concentration space, the orthogonality between T x V ss and Im[ S ] persists and the bound becomes strict for Cov( I n ) ij = ⟨ π ( e j ) , π ( e i ) ⟩ g , where π is the g -orthogonal projection to T x V ss and ⟨ ., . ⟩ g the respective bilinear product.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_351><loc_394><loc_414>Moreover, this article introduces the notion of absolute sensitivity which remedies the basis dependence of the sensitivity matrix χ . Absolute sensitivities are defined purely through the geometry of concentration space and the embedding of the steady state manifold within it. For quasi-thermostatic CRN, it has been shown that the absolute sensitivities α i of the chemicals X i lie in the interval [0 , 1] and therefore they can be used to quantify approximate concentration robustness as well as highly sensitive chemicals. Moreover, it shows how the strict requirements for absolute concentration robustness can be meaningfully relaxed: Absolute concentration robustness in X i requires α j → i to vanish</text>
<footnote><loc_105><loc_418><loc_394><loc_429>5 It requires the solution of a polynomial of degree 5 in x 3 with constants in Q [ k ± i , η 1 , η 2 ]. In general, the situation is even more complex.</footnote>

<page_break>
<text><loc_105><loc_77><loc_393><loc_89>for all j , whereas the vanishing for some j indicates insensitivity of X i to X j which is often a biochemically relevant situation.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_91><loc_394><loc_188>Finally, going from quasi-thermostatic CRNs to more general CRNs allows α i > 1 and α i → j < 0. The condition α i > 1 quantifies hypersensitivity in X i . The condition α i → j < 0 would allow to implement the operation of subtraction via CRN and thus enable various computations, logical circuits, and feedback regulations [33]. Note that in [16], an example with α i → j < 0 is exhibited, by using the concept of sign-sensitivities and computational algebra techniques. It would be especially exciting to obtain α i → j < 0 in reversible CRN because then it would be possible to investigate the thermodynamical cost of computation in CRN. The geometrical characterization of α i → j as ⟨ π ( g -1 e j ) , π ( e i ) ⟩ g provided in Eq. (17) is a helpful tool for finding such CRNs in the future. It enables values of α i → j outside of the interval [0 , 1] not through nonlinearities in kinetics but through non-ideal thermodynamic behavior which can already occur for equilibrium systems. This generalization of the Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivities to non-ideal systems is being explored in currently ongoing work.</text>
<text><loc_105><loc_190><loc_394><loc_281>An application of the concept of absolute sensitivity was presented in Section 5.3: It is easily possible to sample the absolute sensitivity values on the whole space of physiologically meaningful concentration vectors which span several orders of magnitude. This is because the absolute sensitivities do not explicitly depend on on the kinetic rate constants but just on the particular point in concentration space, and because the formulae derived in this article are computationally very cheap. This procedure yields distributions of absolute sensitivity and allows to gauge the robustness behavior of all the chemicals of the CRN. For the example of the core module of the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system the experimentally known robustness in the IDH enzyme could be confirmed. In addition, a hidden symmetry, which is not present at the level of individual point but at the level of distributions, was uncovered. We are looking forward to apply the methodology to the analysis of other CRNs in the future.</text>

<text><loc_105><loc_90><loc_394><loc_131>Here, the behavior of the absolute sensitivity α 4 for the example in Section 5 is analyzed for different sets of kinetic rate constants. In particular, it is known that absolute concentration robustness is achieved when the reactions EI p → E + I and EI p I → EI p +I p are irreversible [50]. Therefore, the focus of the numerical examples will be to investigate the effect of the smallness of the rate constants k -2 and k -4 .</text>

This leads to the condition k -1 k -2 k -3 k -4 = 1. Moreover, it is assumed that the irreversibility is governed by</text>

The dependence of the absolute sensitivity α 4 on (log η 1 , log η 2 ) is shown in Fig. S1. These results show that there is very little difference between ϵ = 0 . 01 and ϵ = 1. However, the quotient k -1 /k -3 has a strong influence on α 4 and for k -1 ≫ 100 k -3 the lowest values for the absolute sensitivity are obtained. These values are consistently low for all physiologically relevant values of ( η 1 , η 2 ), where both conserved quantities range from 10 -10 to 10.</text>

This shows that there is no symmetry of the form \alpha = \alpha and \alpha = \alpha for a
fixed point x.  Hence, the symmetry seen in Figure 4 must appear at the level
of distributions.
