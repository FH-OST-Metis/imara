<text><loc_72><loc_188><loc_428><loc_320>The paper addresses the problem of meta order execution from a broker-dealer's point of view in Almgren-Chriss model under execution risk. A broker-dealer agency is authorized to execute an order of trading on some client's behalf. The strategies that the agent is allowed to deploy is subject to a benchmark, referred to as the reference strategy, regulated by the client. We formulate the broker's problem as a utility maximization problem in which the broker seeks to maximize his utility of excess profit-and-loss at the execution horizon, of which optimal feedback strategies are obtained in closed form. In the absence of execution risk, the optimal strategies subject to reference strategies are deterministic. We establish an affine structure among the trading trajectories under optimal strategies subject to general reference strategies using implementation shortfall (IS) and target close (TC) orders as basis. Furthermore, an approximation theorem is proposed to show that with small error, general reference strategies can be approximated by piece-wise constant ones, of which the optimal strategy is piece-wise linear combination between IS and TC orders. We conclude the paper with numerical experiments illustrating the trading trajectories as well as histograms of terminal wealth and utility at investment horizon under optimal strategies versus those under TWAP strategies.</text>

<section_header_level_1><loc_51><loc_32><loc_144><loc_39>1 Introduction</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_51><loc_49><loc_449><loc_141>In the financial industry, large position holders such as pension funds or investment banks for various reasons are required to trade in or trade out from their current position to an updated target, possibly subject to a given execution horizon which may vary from days to weeks. The net holdings to be adjusted between the current and the target positions are usually too large to be simply dumped to the market without a priori deliberately assessing the trade's market impact. Untamed price impact by trading may result in significant transaction cost, potentially turned into a substantial loss. Such an execution risk requires to be properly managed and controlled; otherwise it would eventually influence the position holder's overall profit and loss (P&L). A common practice is to delegate the execution to the firm's order execution department or outsource to a broker-dealer agency.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_144><loc_449><loc_322>The large position holders, while delegating their tasks to an agency for execution, may have in mind their own preferred strategies or benchmarks that they would like the delegated agent to closely track along. For instance, implementation shortfall (IS) orders [1] are frequently employed by managers for the purpose of short-term alpha pursuit. IS orders are constructed with a pre-trade benchmark price in mind, aiming at executing orders at an average price that remains relatively close to the market price at the beginning of the trade. Managers can often use arrival prices to help measure total trading costs: the closer the execution price is to the arrival price, the lower the associated costs (see CFA-level-II [2]). On the contrary, target close (TC) orders [3], often deployed by index-fund managers for the purpose of minimizing fund risk and tracking error, are formulated with a post-trade benchmark price in order to secure a price in average that remains relatively close to the closing price. This is often important for mutual fund managers who manage funds that only calculate NAV once daily at closing. Volume weighted average price (VWAP) and Time weighted average price (TWAP) strategies are benchmarks specified for trading sequences with constant trading rate in wall clock time (TWAP) and in volume time (VWAP) respectively. These algorithmic trading strategies are examples of benchmarks that may be imposed as trading constraints to the agent who is missioned to trade in or trade out the position. We shall delve into this type of order execution problems subject to a pre-specified benchmark strategy, which we refer to as the reference strategy (RS for short), as a stochastic control problem and determine their corresponding optimal strategies in feedback form.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_325><loc_449><loc_450>The pioneering works in [4], [1], [5] and [6] are among the first to deal with the problem of order execution under price impact. Since its introduction to the order execution problem, numerous progresses and extensions on the classical Almgren-Chriss framework have been made extensively. For instance, [7] and [8] introduced the notion of transient impact to account for the dissipation of price impacts from the past trades. [9] discusses the objective in the optimization problem, while [10] extends the classical mean-variance framework first considered in [4] to encompass general risk measures as penalty for risk aversion. [11], [12], [13] solve the optimal execution problem in relation to a VWAP benchmark, while [14] asserts the use of the arrival price as a benchmark within the Almgren-Chriss framework. In fact, the arrival price, also known as 'pre-trade benchmark', appears to be the most commonly used benchmark in academic papers. The closing price is the value of a security at its last transaction during a trading session [3] [15]. Average price benchmarks may also appear in accelerated share repurchase (ASR) contracts [16][17], which can be regarded as optimal execution problems with optimal stopping. Above all, [18] introduces the concept of execution risk, that</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_32><loc_449><loc_93>pre-scheduled orders may not be fully executed, of which the empirical evidence is confirmed by [19] that the inventory processes of traders invariably contain a Brownian motion term, which contradicts the common assumption adopted in most optimal execution models that the inventory process is absolute continuous. Another perspective on introducing the noise term into the inventory process is that when a centralized trading desk aggregates order flows within a financial institution, stochastic order flow arises [20] [21]. The aforementioned papers are by no means meant for an exhausting list in literature on this line of active research.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_96><loc_449><loc_252>In the current paper, we consider the order execution problem from a broker-dealer's point of view. Assume that a broker is delegated to reallocate a client's holdings of a certain stock under the Almgren-Chriss model with execution risk. The broker is regulated by his client to track a benchmark strategy, i.e., the reference strategy, to the client's preference. The broker's incentive of executing client's order in this circumstance is to maximize his own expected P&L excess to that of the reference strategy, marked-to-market. To account for risk aversion, we recast the broker's order execution problem as a utility maximization problem and, in certain cases, are able to solve the problem in closed form. In particular, when execution risk vanishes, or becomes negligible, we show that there exists an 'affine structure' among the optimal strategies induced from various reference strategies. This algebraic structure is supposed to help the broker for concocting and understanding optimal strategies subject to client's general reference strategies. We argue that the framework is highly versatile in the sense that it encompasses commonly deployed execution strategies such as IS, TC as well as TWAP and VWAP orders as special cases for benchmarking. As per the algebraic structure, it follows that, for any given continuous reference strategy which can be approximated by a piece-wise constant function, we show that its corresponding optimal strategy can also be approximated by those induced from the piece-wise constant strategies.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_256><loc_449><loc_370>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we lay out the price impact model of AlmgrenChriss under execution risk and incorporate reference strategies into the problem of order execution. Section 3 presents the optimal feedback control of the order execution problem in Theorem 1 as one of the main results in the paper. Section 4 focuses and provides detailed discussions on the optimal strategies when execution risk vanishes. Reference strategies and their associated optimal strategies considered in Section 4 include IS and TC orders as well as piece-wise constant strategies. The emphasis is put on an 'affine structure' among the trading trajectories induced by general reference strategies using unit IS and unit TC orders as a basis. Numerical examples illustrating the trading trajectories and the performance analysis under the optimal and TWAP strategies are shown and discussed in Section 5. For the sake of smooth reading, technical proofs of all the theorems, propositions and lemmas are postponed and collected till the end of the paper as an appendix in Section A.</text>

Let x t be the number of shares the broker holds at time t ∈ [0 , T ] during the reallocation process and ˜ S t the transacted price at time t . The price dynamic is assumed to follow the Almgren-Chriss model [4] [1] [5]. In the Almgren-Chriss framework, the transacted price ˜ S t consists of the fair price S t and a slippage. The fair price S t is driven by the SDE</text>

We remark that in the original setting of Almgren-Chriss and its extensions, the trading rate v t plays a dual role. On the one hand, it serves as the realized trading rate per the relationship v t = -˙ x t between x t and v t . On the other hand, it is regarded as the control variable in the problem of optimal execution. These two seemingly distinct roles coincide if all the scheduled orders are guaranteed fully executed. However, in reality it is well noticed among practitioners that, while executing a sequence of pre-scheduled orders, the orders in the sequence may not be fully executed, resulting in an uncontrollable realized order flow. This introduces an additional risk to the order execution problem, the execution risk . To account for this uncertainty, we introduce a noise component driven by a correlated Brownian motion Z t into the dynamic of the position x t as</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_356><loc_449><loc_417>The diffusion term m ( v ) characterizes the magnitude of execution risk. It is worth to reiterate that in a recent work in [19], the authors showed that the presence of a Brownian component in the broker's inventory during reallocation process is statistically significant. Moreover, because of this execution risk, the broker is no longer guaranteed to achieve his intended position at the terminal time T , which gives rise to an additional opportunity cost. As a result, the broker is obligated to take a final block trade at time T at a worse price. Overall, the realised P&L at the horizon T is given by</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_130><loc_449><loc_212>A common practice in order execution brokerage is that clients may come forward to brokers with their own preferred strategies for benchmarking. These benchmark strategies can be either strategies suggested by elite investors or commonly used ones such as TWAP strategies. We shall refer to these pre-specified benchmark strategies as reference strategies . We consider the reference strategies that can be represented by a deterministic function ( R t ) t ∈ [0 ,T ] with R 0 ≡ x 0 and R T ≡ A hereafter. Moreover, we assume that R t is a differentiable a.e. function. The broker's incentive of executing client's order is thus to maximize his own expected P&L excess to that of the reference strategy, marked-to-market. Specifically, by disregarding the price impact and slippages incurred from order execution, the stock price S 0 t reads</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_49><loc_449><loc_99>In this section, we recast the problem of order execution as a utility maximization problem as follows. Recall that (Ω , F , P ) denotes a complete probability space equipped with a filtration ( F t ) t ≥ 0 satisfying the usual conditions. We assume that all random variables and stochastic processes are defined on (Ω , F , ( F t ) t ≥ 0 , P ) .

<text><loc_51><loc_120><loc_449><loc_148>to meet the assumptions given in [22] and [23], which assure the solvability of both the risk-neutral problem and the risk-aversion one.

<formula><loc_219><loc_158><loc_449><loc_171>\sup _ { v \in \mathcal { A } } \mathbb { E } \left [ u \left ( \tilde { \mathbf I } \right ) \right ] ,</formula>
<text><loc_51><loc_180><loc_449><loc_252>where the utility function u ( x ) := 1 θ (1 -e -θx ) , θ > 0 represents the broker's preference following CARA (Constant Absolute Risk Aversion) preference and θ > 0 is the risk-aversion parameter. Note that as θ ↓ 0 , the utility function u ( x ) = lim θ ↓ 0 1 θ (1 -e -θx ) = x reflects a risk-neutral preference. When the utility function is selected as u ( x ) = x , we solve the stochastic control problem and give the close form of the value function E [ ˜ Π ] ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ v = v ∗∗ = sup v ∈A E [ ˜ Π ] < ∞ , where v ∗∗ ∈ A is the optimal feedback control in the risk-neutral case, see in Appendix A.2. Moreover, when u ( x ) = 1 θ (1 -e -θx ) , u ′ ( x ) = e -θx > 0 , u ′′ ( x ) = -θe -θx < 0 , so u ( · ) is a increasing concave function.

The financial rationale is as follows. Recall that θ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion for the utility function and σ is the volatility of stock price. Hence, if either of the parameters increases, the broker is more concerned with the price risk than the execution risk, he tends toward trading faster at the beginning and more slowly thereafter. Also, since η is the coefficient of slippage, as it decreases, the slippage decreases as well, resulting in lower cost from faster transactions.

We provide a financial rationale of this combination of parameters as follows. Note that the combination resembles the Merton ratio in Merton's optimal portfolio problem in the market consisting of two assets: one risky and the other risk-less. The agent is risk averse with power utility u ( x ) = x γ and the dynamic of risky asset is governed by a geometric Brownian motion with expected return µ and volatility σ . The risk-less asset is assumed accruing zero interest. In this setting, the Merton ratio, which represents the percentage of wealth invested in the risky asset, is given by µ (1 -γ ) σ 2 . In our setting, the broker is with exponential utility u ( x ) = 1 θ (1 -e -θx ) and the stock price S t is assumed following an arithmetic Brownian motion with drift µ and volatility σ , i.e.,</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_262><loc_449><loc_334>We consider in this section the reference strategies that are piece-wise constant across time. The consideration is that, to possibly account for real time market environments during the entire reallocation process, the broker's strategies may be subject to interval TWAP or VWAP strategies. For example, in an intraday trading activity, it is documented that the market trades much more actively at the times close to opening and closing than that in the middle of common trading days. Also, in the case where trading horizon across multiple days, the broker is most likely treating each trading day individually. In these regards, a piece-wise constant reference strategy is considered plausible.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_337><loc_449><loc_387>Theoretically, as will be demonstrated, optimal trajectories subject to piece-wise constant reference strategies exhibit an elegant algebraic structure, derived from the unit IS and unit TC orders discussed in Sections 4.2.

Concretely, a generic piece-wise constant reference strategy R t is defined as</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_205><loc_449><loc_320>Notice that the IS t and TC t in Proposition 4 are indeed respectively the unit IS order given in (7) and the unit TC order in (9). Proposition 4 essentially states that, for a given piece-wise constant reference strategy, its corresponding optimal solution in each sub-interval is given by an affine transformation of a unit IS order and a unit TC order. In this sense we may regard the unit IS orders and the unit TC orders obtained in Sections 4.2 as the building blocks or bases for optimal trajectories under piece-wise constant reference strategies. The algebraic structure of the optimal trajectories is thus depicted by the affine space generated by the unit IS and unit TC orders. What are left to be determined are the coefficients that are sub-interval dependent. In practice, one should firstly calculate a k 's by linear combinations of R ( i ) 's, then optimal strategy is obtained by connecting a k 's using unit IS and unit TC orders. As an example, Figure (5) shows the plots of a piece-wise constant reference strategy (in dotted red) its optimal trajectory (in blue) with three sub-intervals n = 3 , the other parameters are given by T = 3 , κ = 5 , R (1) = 15 2 , R (2) = 9 2 , R (3) = 3 2 , x 0 = 9 , A = 0 .

It is worth mentioning that, since η reflects the level of transaction costs, as the value of η increases, transaction cost becomes more significant in the determination of optimal strategies. Consequently, the optimal strategy tends to align more closely with the classical TWAP strategy. In other words, a higher η places greater emphasis on minimizing transaction costs, motivating the adoption of a strategy that mirrors the TWAP approach, which aims for consistent execution over time.</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_101><loc_449><loc_162>strategy not only consistently achieves higher average terminal wealth and utility than those under TWAP but also bears lower variability. Furthermore, an intriguing observation is made regarding the tail ends of the distribution. Specifically, the TWAP strategy demonstrates a greater density in these tail regions, indicating a higher likelihood of incurring significant losses when compared to our optimal strategy. This discrepancy in density at the tail end reinforces the notion that the TWAP strategy may accentuate the potential for unfavorable outcomes, thus reflecting a subpar approach to risk management.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_165><loc_449><loc_226>Finally, we stress test the optimal and the TWAP strategies against extreme parameters. While the remaining parameters are held the same as in the benchmark case, the stock volatility σ is scaled up by ten folds in Scenario 1, the terminal penalty coefficient β up by ten folds in Scenario 2, the execution risk m 0 up by a hundred folds in Scenario 3, and lastly in Scenario 4 down by 0.1 hundred folds the temporary cost η . Table 2 summarizes the parameters that are stress tested in each scenario and Figure 13 shows the histograms and boxplots of P&Ls at the terminal time under the optimal and the TWAP strategies.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_229><loc_449><loc_279>Apparently, in all the scenarios the histograms under optimal strategies are concentrated around zero whereas those under TWAP strategies are much more widely spreading. Also, the sample means under optimal strategies are higher than those of TWAP strategies. We conclude that, even under extreme situations, the optimal strategies outperform TWAP strategies not only in higher averaged P&L but also with lower volatility risk, which shows the robustness of our results.</text>

<text><loc_51><loc_49><loc_449><loc_141>In this article, we showed how the broker's order execution problem under execution risk subject to client's reference strategy can be recast as a utility maximization problem. The optimal solution to the utility maximization problem was obtained by solving an associated Riccati differential equation and was presented in feedback form. When execution risk vanishes, the optimal strategies become deterministic and were given in closed form. We showed that trading trajectories subject to the unit IS and the unit TC orders form a basis of an affine structure for trading trajectories under optimal strategies subject to general piece-wise constant reference strategies. As for general continuous reference strategies, we proved an approximation and stability theorem for the trading trajectory under the corresponding optimal strategy via the trajectories from piece-wise constant reference strategies.</text>
<text><loc_51><loc_144><loc_449><loc_216>Numerical experiments showed that the optimal strategies not only achieve higher expected values but also bear lower variabilities as opposed to those under TWAP strategies. Numerical performance analysis and stress tests confirmed that optimal strategies outperform TWAP strategies, by a wide margin in certain cases. Possible extensions of the framework considered in the paper include (a) a stochastic component to the price evolution reflecting the overall market activity such macroeconomics factors or news; (b) the price impact, rather than permanent, being transient with proper decay kernel. We leave these considerations to a future study.</text>
