## Abstract

This article analyzes the geometric properties of an idempotent, non-associative algebraic structure that extends the Max-Times semiring. This algebraic structure is useful for studying systems of MaxTimes and Max-Plus equations, employing an appropriate notion of a non-associative determinant. We consider a connected ultrametric distance and demonstrate that it implies, among other properties, an analogue of the Pythagorean relation. To this end, we introduce a suitable notion of a right angle between two vectors and investigate a trigonometric concept associated with the Chebyshev unit ball. Following this approach, we explore the potential implications of these properties in the complex plane.

We provide an algebraic definition of a line passing through two points, which corresponds to the Painlev´ e-Peano-Kuratowski limit of a sequence of generalized lines. We establish that this definition leads to distinctive geometric properties; in particular, two distinct parallel lines may share an infinite number of points.

## Introduction

It is well known that algebras associated with idempotent semirings are related to particular geometric representations. This article investigates some of these properties through the non-associative symmetrization of Max-Times algebras. The concept of B -convexity was introduced in [12] as a Painlev´ e-Kuratowski limit of generalized convexities. 1 This fundamental idea is related to earlier work by Ben-Tal [5] and Avriel [2]. When restricted to the nonnegative orthant, B -convexity coincides with Max-Times convexity. In this context, an algebraic formulation has been established in the idempotent Max-Times semiring ( R + , max , × ) by applying the transformation + → max in the nonnegative Euclidean orthant. The idempotent Max-Times semiring is homeomorphic to the Max-Plus semiring ( R ∪{-∞} , max , +) via a logarithmic transformation, and B -convex sets emerge from a broad class of idempotent algebraic structures introduced in [26] and derived from the notion of dequantization (see also [24]).

Hahn-Banach-type separation properties [14] and fixed-point results have been established in [13]. Other idempotent convex structures have been proposed in [1] and [30]. The algebraic formulation of B -convexity was previously limited to the Max-Times semi-module ( R n + , ∨ , × ). To address this limitation, an idempotent and non-associative binary operation was introduced in [8] by considering a special class of idempotent and non-associative magmas. In this paper, we introduce an n -ary operation associated with a suitable class of

1 The letter B , used to define a corresponding notion of convexity may be confusing in light of the concept of convexity introduced by Anatole Beck in Banach spaces in 1962. It was chosen due to the origins of the names of several members of the mathematics department at the University of Perpignan at the time of the publication of the first paper [12]. Additionally, it can be linked to the work of Aaron Ben-Tal [5], whose paper plays a crucial role in the context of these articles. Another reason for this choice is that the operation /squareplus , pronounced ' B oxplus,' bears a graphical resemblance to the Chebyshev unit ball ( /lscript ∞ ) when represented in two dimensions with Cartesian coordinates. This ball plays a central role in the proposed approach and is itself the Hausdorff limit of the sequence of /lscript p balls as p →∞ .

regularized semicontinuous operators. It is worth noting that, when involving only two points, the idempotent and non-associative algebraic structures considered are also mentioned by Gaubert [16] and discussed Viro [31], who explored the complex case.

Note that there exist other approaches to extending idempotent algebraic structures. For example, Izhakian and Rowen [19] introduced supertropical algebra, which involves a similar type of construction based on the notion of a valued monoid. Additionally, the concept of hyperfields, introduced in [21] and [25], provides an alternative approach.

Relaxing associativity preserves both symmetry and idempotency. It has been shown that this notion of convexity can be equivalently characterized by the Kuratowski-Painlev´ e limit of the generalized convex hull of two points as defined in [12]. Some separation results in R n have been established in [9], and the limiting structure of polytopes has been analyzed in [10].

More recently, these structures have been examined from an algebraic perspective to compute the limit solutions of systems of Max-Times equations, particularly by introducing a special determinant formulation. These results also have geometric implications for determining the equation of a limit hyperplane passing through n points, with possible extensions to Max-Plus algebra.

This paper continues prior research on this topic from a geometric perspective, introducing appropriate notions of distance. Throughout the paper, an idempotent analogue of subtraction plays a key role.

First, we define a space notion suited to the algebraic structure under consideration and generalize the definition of B -space introduced in [13]. Second, we construct a sequence of generalized metrics via an appropriate homeomorphic transformation of the vector space structure. We demonstrate that their limit properties yield an ultrametric distance intimately linked to the algebraic structure considered. To this end, we derive a notion of orthogonality from the limit inner product defined in [8]. As a result, we establish geometric properties of a special class of right-angle triples, specifically proving a Pythagorean-type relation within this framework. Using the limiting properties of the generalized inner product, we construct a pseudocosine limit function, where the pseudo-cosine is derived from the limiting inner product, and the pseudo-sine stems from the two-dimensional determinant formula established in [11]. Following this approach, we explore potential implications of these properties in the complex plane.

Finally, the paper investigates a notion of line corresponding to the non-associative algebraic structure under study. We show that the Painlev´ e-Kuratowski limit of a sequence of generalized lines admits an algebraic description extending a previous result in [8] for a line segment. We establish a condition ensuring that two boundary lines are parallel, analogous (in a certain sense) to the criterion for parallel lines in a vector space. The paper concludes with an analysis of the two-dimensional case, in which a special idempotent geometry is examined. Building on [11], we demonstrate how to compute the equation of a two-dimensional line. The final result describes a plane geometry where a unique line passes through two distinct points, and where a line segment can be extended to a half-line. However, two distinct parallel lines may share an infinite number of points.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 1 introduces the framework of the non-associative idempotent algebraic structure defined in [8], along with some associated convexity notions. Section 2 defines field and space concepts related to this algebraic structure, providing illustrative examples. Section 3 derives an ultrametric distance as the limit of a sequence of generalized metrics. In this context, a triangular equality is established for a special class of right-angle triples. Section 4 explores inner product properties established in [9] and introduces a related notion of pseudo-cosine. Section 5 presents an algebraic description of a line. The paper concludes with an analysis of the geometric implications of the considered algebraic structure.

## 1 Idempotent and Non-Associative Algebraic and Convex Structure

## 1.1 Isomorphism of vector-Space Structures in Limit

For all p ∈ N , let us consider a bijection ϕ p : R -→ R defined by:

$$\varphi _ { p } \colon \lambda \longrightarrow \lambda ^ { 2 p + 1 }$$

and φ p ( x 1 , ..., x n ) = ( ϕ p ( x 1 ) , ..., ϕ p ( x n )). This is closely related to the approach proposed by Ben-Tal [5] and Avriel [2]. One can induce a field structure on R for which ϕ p becomes a field isomorphism. For λ, µ ∈ R , the indexed sum and the indexed product are simply given by and

$$\lambda ^ { \ p } _ { + } & = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \varphi _ { p } ( \lambda ) + \varphi _ { p } ( \mu ) ) = ( \lambda ^ { 2 p + 1 } + \mu ^ { 2 p + 1 } ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } } , \\ & \\ & \\ & , \ p$$

These two operations define a scalar field ( R , p + , · ). Given this change of notation via ϕ p and φ p , we can define a R -vector space structure on R n by: λ ϕ p · x = φ -1 p ( ϕ p ( λ ) · φ p ( x ) ) = λ · x and x ϕ p + y = φ -1 p ( φ p ( x ) + φ p ( y ) ) . We call these two operations the multiplication by scalar and the indexed sum (indexed by ϕ p ).

$$\lambda \cdot \mu = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \varphi _ { p } ( \lambda ) \cdot \varphi _ { p } ( \mu ) ) = \lambda \cdot \mu . \\ \intertext { f i n e a s c a l r e f i d e { \left ( \mathbb { R } , \stackrel { p } { + } , \cdot \right ) } . \text { Given this change of notation via } \varphi _ { p } \text { and } \phi _ { p } , w e c a n d f i n e }$$

The ϕ p -sum denoted ϕ p ∑ of ( x (1) , ..., x ( m ) ) ∈ R n × m is defined by 2

$$\sum _ { j \in [ m ] } ^ { \varphi _ { p } } x ^ { ( j ) } = \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \sum _ { j \in [ m ] } \phi _ { p } ( x ^ { ( j ) } ) \right ) . \\$$

For the sake simplicity, throughout the paper we denote for all x, y ∈ R n :

$$x + y = x + \stackrel { p } { y } .$$

Recall that Kuratowski-Painlev´ e lower limit of the sequence of sets { A n } n ∈ N , denoted Li n →∞ A n , is the set of points x for which there exists a sequence { x ( n ) } n ∈ N of points such that x ( n ) ∈ A n for all n and x = lim n →∞ x ( n ) . The Kuratowski-Painlev´ e upper limit of the sequence of sets { A n } n ∈ N , denoted Ls n →∞ A n , is the set of points x for which there exists a subsequence { x ( n k ) } k ∈ N of points such that x ( n k ) ∈ A n k for all k and x = lim k →∞ x ( n k ) . A sequence { A n } n ∈ N of subsets of R n is said to converge, in the Kuratowski-Painlev´ e sense, to a set A if Ls n →∞ A n = A = Li n →∞ A n , in which case we write A = Lim n →∞ A n .

In [8] it was shown that for all λ, µ ∈ R we have:

Along this line one can introduce the binary operation /squareplus defined for all λ, µ ∈ R by:

$$\text {shown that for all } X , \mu \in \mathbb { E } \text { we have.} \\ \lim _ { p \longrightarrow + \infty } \lambda + \mu = \begin{cases} \frac { p } { 2 } ( \lambda + \mu ) & \text {if } \ | \lambda | > \ | \mu | \\ \mu & \text {if } \ | \lambda | < \ | \mu | . \end{cases}$$

$$\lambda \oplus \mu = \lim _ { p \rightarrow + \infty } \lambda \stackrel { p } { + } \mu .$$

Though the operation /squareplus does not satisfy associativity, it can be extended by constructing a non-associative algebraic structure which returns to a given n -tuple a real value. For all x ∈ R n and all subsets I of [ n ], let us consider the map ξ I [ x ] : R -→ Z defined for all α ∈ R by

$$\xi _ { I } [ x ] ( \alpha ) = C \text {and} \{ i \in I \colon x _ { i } = \alpha \} - C \text {card} \{ i \in I \colon x _ { i } = - \alpha \} .$$

This map measures the symmetry of the occurrences of a given value α in the coordinates of a vector x . R n

For all x ∈ let J I ( x ) be a subset of I defined by

/negationslash

J I ( x ) is called the residual index set of x . It is obtained by dropping from I all the i 's such that Card { j ∈ I : x j = x i } = Card { j ∈ I : x j = -x i } .

$$\mathcal { J } _ { I } ( x ) = \left \{ j \in I \colon \xi _ { I } [ x ] ( x _ { j } ) \neq 0 \right \} = I \langle \{ i \in I \colon \xi _ { I } [ x ] ( x _ { i } ) = 0 \} . \\ \text {called the residual index set} \quad \text {of } x . \ \text {It is obtained by dropping from } I \text { all the } \overset { \dots } { s } \text { such that}$$

For all positive natural numbers n and for all subsets I of [ n ], let Ϝ I : R n -→ R be the map defined for all x ∈ R n by

2 For all positive natural numbers n , [ n ] = { 1 , ..., n } .

 where ξ I [ x ] is the map defined in (8) and J I ( x ) is the residual index set of x . The operation that takes an n -tuple ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) from R n and returns a single real value Ϝ I ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) is called an n -ary extension of the binary operation /squareplus , for all natural numbers n ≥ 1 and all x ∈ R n , where I is a nonempty subset of [ n ]. According to [8], for any n -tuple x = ( x 1 , . . . , x n ), the operation can be defined as:

$$F _ { I } ( x ) = \begin{cases} \max _ { i \in J _ { 1 } ( x ) } x _ { i } & \text {if} \quad \mathcal { J } _ { I } ( x ) \neq \emptyset \quad \text {and} \quad \xi _ { I } [ x ] ( \max _ { i \in J _ { 1 } ( x ) } | x _ { i } | ) > 0 \\ \min _ { i \in J _ { 1 } ( x ) } x _ { i } & \text {if} \quad \mathcal { J } _ { I } ( x ) \neq \emptyset \quad \text {and} \quad \xi _ { I } [ x ] ( \max _ { i \in J _ { 1 } ( x ) } | x _ { i } | ) < 0 \\ 0 & \text {if} \quad \mathcal { J } _ { I } ( x ) = \emptyset , \end{cases}$$

/negationslash

$$\bigoplus _ { i \in I } x _ { i } = \lim _ { p \to \infty } \sum _ { i \in I } x _ { i } = F _ { I } ( x ) . \\$$

Clearly, this operation encompasses as a special case the binary operation mentioned in [16] and defined in equation (6). For all ( x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ R 2 :

$$\prod _ { i \in \{ 1 , 2 \} } x _ { i } = x _ { 1 } \, \mathbb { E } \, x _ { 2 } .$$

For example, if x = ( -3 , -2 , 3 , 3 , 1 , -3), we have F [6] ( -3 , -2 , 3 , 3 , 1 , -3) = F [2] ( -2 , 1) = -2 = /squareplus i ∈ [6] x i .

$$[ x _ { i } \oplus ( \prod _ { j \in I \ \{ i \} } x _ { j } ) ] \in \{ 0 , \prod _ { j \in I } x _ { j } \} \quad \text {and} \quad \prod _ { i \in I } x _ { i } = \prod _ { i \in I } \left [ x _ { i } \oplus ( \prod _ { j \in I \ \{ i \} } x _ { j } ) \right ] . \\ \intertext { t h e a l e r a b r a c $ \text {structure } ( \mathbb { R } \oplus \cdot ) \colon \text { can be extended to } \mathbb { R } ^ { n } } \text { suppose that } x _ { i } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \quad \text {and} \quad \text {let us denote}$$

There are some basic properties that can be inherited from the above algebraic structure: ( i ) for all α ∈ R , one has: α ( /squareplus i ∈ I x i ) = /squareplus i ∈ I ( αx i ); ( ii ) suppose that x ∈ /epsilon1 R n + where /epsilon1 is +1 or -1. Then /squareplus i ∈ I x i = /epsilon1 max i ∈ I { /epsilon1x i } ; ( iii ) we have | /squareplus i ∈ I x i | ≤ /squareplus i ∈ I | x i | ; ( iv ) for all x ∈ R n :

The algebraic structure ( R , /squareplus , · ) can be extended to R n . Suppose that x, y ∈ R n , and let us denote x /squareplus y = ( x 1 /squareplus y 1 , ..., x n /squareplus y n ) . Moreover, let us consider m vectors x (1) , ..., x ( m ) ∈ R n , and define

$$\prod _ { j \in [ m ] } x ^ { ( j ) } & = \left ( \prod _ { j \in [ m ] } x _ { 1 } ^ { ( j ) } , \dots , \prod _ { j \in [ m ] } x _ { n } ^ { ( j ) } \right ) . \\$$

The n -ary operation ( x 1 , ..., x n ) → /squareplus i ∈ [ n ] x i is not associative. To simplify the notations of the paper, for all z ∈ { z i 1 ,...,i m : i k ∈ I k , k ∈ [ m ] } , where I 1 , ..., I m are m index subsets of N , we use the notation:

$$\prod _ { \substack { i _ { k } \in I _ { k } \\ k \in [ m ] } } z _ { i _ { 1 } , \dots , i _ { n } } = \prod _ { ( i _ { 1 } , \dots , i _ { m } ) \in \prod _ { k \in [ m ] } I _ { k } } z _ { i _ { 1 } , \dots , i _ { m } } .$$

Notice that since the operation /squareplus is not associative, it can be ambiguous to apply without using the symbol /squareplus indexed on a given finite subset I . In the remainder, for the sake of simplicity, and when it is more convenient, we will adopt the following notational convention. For all x ∈ R n :

$$\coprod _ { i \in [ n ] } x _ { i } = x _ { i } \, \mathbb { I } \, \mathbb { \cdots } \, \mathbb { I } \, x _ { n } .$$

In the sequel, for all x, y ∈ R n we will often use the following notation to define an idempotent analogue of the subtraction operation:

$$x \, \Box \, y = x \, \mathbb { E } \left ( - y \right ) .$$

## 1.2 Scalar Products and Determinants in Limit

This section presents the algebraic properties induced by an isomorphism between a scalar field and a set and their implications on the scalar product. If 〈· , ·〉 is the canonical inner product over R n , then there exists a symmetric bilinear form 〈· , ·〉 ϕ p : R n × R n -→ R defined by:

$$\langle x , y \rangle _ { \varphi _ { p } } = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \langle \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) \rangle ) = ( \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } x _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } y _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } } .$$

Now, let us denote [ 〈 y, ·〉 ϕ p ≤ λ ] = { x ∈ R n : 〈 y, x 〉 ϕ p ≤ λ } . For the sake of simplicity, let us denote 〈· , ·〉 p this scalar product.

In what follows, we state some results obtained in [8, 9] by taking the limit. We first introduce the operation 〈· , ·〉 ∞ : R n × R n -→ R defined for all x, y ∈ R n by 〈 x, y 〉 ∞ = /squareplus i ∈ [ n ] x i y i . Let ‖ · ‖ ∞ be the Tchebychev norm defined by ‖ x ‖ ∞ = max i ∈ [ n ] | x i | . It is established in [8] that for all x, y ∈ R n , we have: ( i ) √ 〈 x, x 〉 ∞ = ‖ x ‖ ∞ ; ( ii ) |〈 x, y 〉 ∞ | ≤ ‖ x ‖ ∞ ‖ y ‖ ∞ ; ( iii ) for all α ∈ R , α 〈 x, y 〉 ∞ = 〈 αx, y 〉 ∞ = 〈 x, αy 〉 ∞ . By definition, we have for all x, y ∈ R n :

$$\langle x , y \rangle _ { \infty } = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \langle x , y \rangle _ { p } .$$

A map f : R n -→ R defined as f ( x ) = 〈 a, x 〉 ∞ for some a ∈ R n is called an idempotent symmetric form . In the following, for all maps f : R n -→ R and all real numbers c , the notation [ f ≤ c ] stands for the set f -1 ( ] -∞ , c ] ). Similarly, [ f &lt; c ] stands for f -1 ( ] -∞ , c [ ) and [ f ≥ c ] = [ -f ≤ -c ]. For all u, v ∈ R , let us define the binary operation

Note that in [19], a polynomial theory for supertropical algebra was proposed. To achieve this, a similar operation was constructed by extending the tropical semiring with a suitable valuation function. Both proposed constructions follow a similar principle. However, in our approach, this binary operation is derived from the idempotent semiring ( R + , max , · ) and the absolute value function.

$$\begin{array} { r } { \frac { u \, \bar { \ } v = \begin{cases} u & i f \quad | u | \ > \ | v | \\ v & i f \quad | u | \ < \ | v | . } \\ \end{cases} } \\ { o m i a l l \, t h e r o y \, f o r \, s u p t r o p i c a l \, a g e b r a \, w a s \, p o s e d . } \\ { d \, b y \, e x t e n d i n g \, t h e \, t r o p i c a l \, s e m i r i n g \, w i t h \, a \, s u i t b l e } \end{array}$$

An elementary calculus shows that u /squareplus v = 1 2 [ u -/slurbelow v -[ ( -u ) -/slurbelow ( -v ) ] ] . It was shown in [14], that this operation is associative.

Given m elements u 1 , ..., u m of R , not all of which are 0, let I + , respectively I -, be the set of indices for which 0 &lt; u i , respectively u i &lt; 0. We can then write u 1 -/slurbelow · · · -/slurbelow u m = ( -/slurbelow i ∈ I + u i ) -/slurbelow ( -/slurbelow i ∈ I -u i ) = (max i ∈ I + u i ) -/slurbelow (min i ∈ I -u i ) from which we have

$$( \max _ { i } \in I _ { + } + u _ { i } ) \subseteq ( \min _ { i } \in I _ { - } \ u _ { i } ) \text { from which we have} \\ u _ { 1 } \subseteq \dots \subseteq u _ { m } = \left \{ \begin{array} { l l l } \max _ { i \in I _ { + } } u _ { i } & i \text { } I _ { - } = \emptyset \text { or } \max _ { i \in I _ { - } } | u _ { i } | < \max _ { i \in I _ { + } } | u _ { i } \\ \min _ { i \in I _ { - } } u _ { i } & i \text { } I _ { + } = \emptyset \text { or } \max _ { i \in I _ { + } } | u _ { i } | < \max _ { i \in I _ { - } } | u _ { i } | \\ \min _ { i \in I _ { - } } u _ { i } & i \text { } \quad \max _ { i \in I _ { - } } | u _ { i } | = \max _ { i \in I _ { + } } | u _ { i } . \\ \end{array}$$

$$g ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } ) = \langle a , x \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { - } = a _ { 1 } x _ { 1 } \, \underbar { \cup } \, \dots \, \underbar { \cup } \, a _ { n } x _ { n } . \\ \intertext { l i n $ [ 0 ] $ t h t f o r $ e v . $ l l $ o c $ T $ r $ b $ h $ t h t $ o t $ e $ - 1 } \, \intertext { i n $ [ 0 ] $ t h t f o r $ e v . $ l l $ o c $ T $ r $ b $ h $ t h t $ o t $ e $ - 1 }$$

We define an idempotent lower symmetric form on R n as a map g : R n → R such that for all ( x 1 , ..., x n ) ∈ R n ,

It was established in [8] that for all c ∈ R , the set g -1 ( ] -∞ , c ]) = { x ∈ R n | g ( x ) ≤ c } is closed. It follows that an idempotent lower symmetric form is lower semi-continuous. It was also shown in [8] that for any a ∈ R n , the idempotent lower symmetrical form g defined by g ( x 1 , ..., x n ) = a 1 x 1 -/slurbelow · · · -/slurbelow a n x n , is the lower semi-continuous regularization of the map x ↦→〈 a, x 〉 ∞ = /squareplus i ∈ [ n ] a i x i .

$$u \stackrel { + } { \sim } v = - [ ( - u ) \smile ( - v ) ] , \\ \text {these lines, one can define an idempotent upper symmetric form as a map} \\$$

Similarly, one can introduce a binary operation defined for all u, v ∈ R as which is associative. Along these lines, one can define an idempotent upper symmetric form as a map h : R n → R such that, for all ( x 1 , ..., x n ) ∈ R n ,

$$h ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } ) = \langle a , x \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { + } = a _ { 1 } x _ { 1 } \underbrace { + } _ { } \dots \underbrace { + } _ { } a _ { n } x _ { n } . \\$$

For all x ∈ R n , we clearly, have the following identities

$$\langle a , x \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { + } = - \langle a , - x \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { - } \text { and } \langle a , x \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { - } = - \langle a , - x \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { + } .$$

For any a ∈ R n , the idempotent upper symmetric form h defined by h ( x 1 , ..., x n ) = a 1 x 1 + /slurbelow · · · + /slurbelow a n x n , , is the upper semi-continuous regularization of the map x ↦→〈 a, x 〉 ∞ = /squareplus i ∈ [ n ] a i x i .

These forms can be related to the construction of a ring involving a balance relation symmetrizing the semi-ring ( R + , ∨ , · ) (see [11], see also [18] and [28] in a Max-Plus context).

More, recently, the following notion of determinant was introduced in [11]. The set R , equipped with the operation /squareplus , allows for the definition of a suitable notion of determinant (see [10, 11]). We denote by M n ( R ) the set of square matrices of order n with real entries. We introduce over M n ( R ) the map Φ p : M n ( R ) -→ M n ( R ) defined for all matrices A = ( a i,j ) i =1 ...n j =1 ..n ∈ M n ( R ) by:

$$\Phi _ { p } ( A ) = \left ( \varphi _ { p } ( a _ { i , j } ) \right ) _ { j = 1 \dots n } = ( a _ { i , j } \, ^ { 2 p + 1 } ) _ { j = 1 \dots n } \, . \\ \intertext { a n d } \Phi _ { p } - 1 \, \colon \mathcal { M } _ { n } ( \mathbb { R } ) \longrightarrow \mathcal { M } _ { n } ( \mathbb { R } ) \, \text { defined by} \, .$$

$$\Phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( A ) = \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( a _ { i , j } ) \right ) _ { j = 1 \dots n } = \left ( a _ { i , j } \frac { \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } } { 2 ^ { 1 + p } } \right ) _ { j = 1 \dots n } . \\ \intertext { s t e n s } \text {extension of the man } \phi _ { n } \text { from } \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \text { to } M _ { n } ( \mathbb { R } ) \text { \ } \Phi _ { n } ( A ) \text { ;} \text { this the } 2 n + 1 \text { Hadamard lower of matrix }$$

Its reciprocal is the map Φ -1 p : M n ( R ) -→ M n ( R ) defined by:

Φ p is a natural extension of the map φ p from R n to M n ( R ). Φ p ( A ) is the 2 p +1 Hadamard power of matrix A . In the following we introduce the matrix product:

$$A ^ { \ p } \cdot x & = \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \Phi _ { p } ( A ) . \phi _ { p } ( x ) ) . \\ \intertext { a n p } \exp { x } & \mapsto A ^ { \ p } \cdot x \text { is } \varphi _ { p } \text {-linear} , \text { that is linear with respect to the algebraic operation}$$

For any n × n matrix A , let | A | denote its determinant. We now introduce the following definition of the ϕ p -determinant:

It is easy to see that the map x ↦→ A p · x is ϕ p -linear, that is linear with respect to the algebraic operation p + and the usual scalar multiplication. Conversely, if g is a ϕ p -linear map then it can be represented by a matrix A such that g ( x ) = A p · x for all x ∈ R n .

$$| A | _ { p } = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 1 } | \Phi _ { p } ( A ) | .$$

$$| A | _ { p } = \left ( \sum _ { \sigma \in \mathfrak { S } _ { n } } s g n ( \sigma ) \prod _ { i \in [ n ] } a _ { i , \sigma ( i ) } ^ { 2 p + 1 } \right ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } } ,$$

where S n is the set of all the permutations defined on [ n ].

Along this line, one can define a determinant in limit as follows:

$$\lim _ { p \to \infty } | A | _ { p } \coloneqq | A | _ { \infty } & = \bigoplus _ { \sigma \in \mathfrak { S } _ { n } } \left ( \ s g n ( \sigma ) \prod _ { i \in [ n ] } a _ { i , \sigma ( i ) } \right ) . \\$$

This notion is compared in [11] to that of permanent originally defined in the framework of Max-Plus algebras (se [7] and [6]).

## 1.3 An Idempotent and Non-associative Convex Structure

In [12], B -convexity is introduced as a limit of linear convexities. The φ p -convex hull of a finite set A = { x (1) , ..., x ( m ) } ⊂ R n is defined by:

$$C o ^ { \phi _ { p } } ( A ) = \left \{ \sum _ { i \in [ m ] } t _ { i } \stackrel { \varphi _ { p } } { \cdot } x ^ { ( i ) } \colon \sum _ { i \in [ m ] } t _ { i } = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( 1 ) , \varphi _ { p } ( t _ { i } ) \geq 0 , i \in [ m ] \right \}$$

which can be rewritten using the fact that ϕ -1 p (1) = 1 and ϕ p is increasing:

$$C o ^ { \phi _ { p } } ( A ) = \left \{ \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \sum _ { i \in [ m ] } t _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } \cdot \phi _ { p } ( x ^ { ( i ) } ) \right ) \colon ( \sum _ { i \in [ m ] } t _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } } = 1 , t _ { i } \geq 0 , i \in [ m ] \right \} .$$

Using the Leibnitz formula yields

Moreover, for all L ⊂ R , we simplify the notations denoting Co p ( L ) = Co φ p ( L ). The definition of B -convex sets is based on the definition of the Kuratowski-Painlev´ e limit of a sequence of φ p -convex sets. For a non-empty finite subset A ⊂ R n we let Co ∞ ( A ) = Ls p -→∞ Co p ( A ). A subset C of R n is B -convex if for all finite subsets A of C , Co ∞ ( A ) ⊂ C . The structure of B -convex sets in R n + will involve the order structure, with respect to the positive cone of R n ; we denote by ∨ i ∈ [ m ] x ( i ) the least upper bound of x (1) , ..., x ( m ) ∈ R n , that is:

$$\bigvee _ { i \in [ m ] } x ^ { ( i ) } = \left ( \max \{ x _ { 1 } ^ { ( 1 ) } , \dots , x _ { 1 } ^ { ( m ) } \} , \dots , \max \{ x _ { n } ^ { ( 1 ) } , \dots , x _ { n } ^ { ( m ) } \} \right ) \\$$

When A = { x (1) , ..., x ( m ) } ⊂ R n + , it was shown in [12] that:

$$C o ^ { \infty } ( A ) = & \{ \ \vee _ { i \in [ m ] } t _ { i } x ^ { ( i ) } \colon t _ { i } \in [ 0 , 1 ] , \max _ { i \in [ m ] } t _ { i } = 1 \} = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } C o ^ { p } ( A ) . \\ \cdots & \quad \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

Moreover it is also proved that the sequence is Hausdorff convergent. In addition, if the set A is contained in any n -dimensional orthant, it was established in [8] that Co ∞ ( A ) = { /squareplus i ∈ [ m ] t i x ( i ) : t i ∈ [0 , 1] , max i ∈ [ m ] t i = 1 } .

An important limitation of this definition of B -convexity is that its algebraic form is restricted to the non-negative orthant R n + , over which the idempotent Max-Times semiring is considered. To circumvent this difficulty an extended definition of B -convexity other R n was suggested in [8]. A subset C of R n is said to be idempotent symmetric convex 3 if, for all x, y ∈ C and for all t ∈ [0 , 1],

If L ⊂ R n + is B -convex, then L = Lim p -→∞ Co p ( L ) = ⋂ ∞ r =0 Co p ( L ). For all S ⊂ R n + , we denote Co ∞ ( S ) = Lim p -→∞ Co p ( S ). Properties of this operation are developed in [12]. In particular, for all S ⊂ R n + , Co ∞ ( S ) is B -convex or equivalently Max-Times convex.

$$x \oplus t y \in C$$

It was shown in [8] that the sequence of subsets { Co ( p ) ( x, y ) } p ∈ N of R n has a Painlev´ e-Kuratowski limit denoted Co ∞ ( x, y ). These points can be expressed trough an explicit algebraic formula in term of the idempotent and non-associative algebraic structure defined on ( R n , /squareplus , · ).

The image is a geometric diagram that appears to be a part of a mathematical or scientific figure. It features a series of points and lines that intersect and form a complex shape. The points are labeled with subscripts, suggesting a sequence or a set of data points. The lines connect these points, creating a network of intersections. The diagram is drawn in a Cartesian coordinate system, with the x-axis and y-axis clearly marked. The lines are straight, and the points are distinctly marked. The diagram does not contain any text or additional elements. It is a static image with no indication of movement or action. The purpose of the diagram is not clear from the image alone, but it could be used to represent a mathematical function, a data set, or a geometric figure.

Moreover, it was established in [8] that this limit entirely characterizes an idempotent symmetric convex set. A subset C of R n is idempotent symmetric convex if and only if for all x, y ∈ R n Co ∞ ( x, y ) ⊂ C . More recently, it has been established in [10] that for all x, y ∈ R n , Co ∞ ( x, y ) is idempotent symmetric convex and thereby Co ∞ ( x, y ) is the smallest idempotent symmetric convex set that contains { x, y } .

3 Referred to as B /sharp -convexity in [8], this concept is given a more intuitive terminology here.

## 2 Idempotent Symmetric and Ultrametric Spaces

The concept of B -space, as introduced in [14], is restricted to the non-negative n -dimensional orthant R n + . In this work, we extend it to the entire Euclidean vector space. This new definition will be useful for analyzing the algebraic structure of a line defined on ( R n , /squareplus , · ).

## 2.1 Idempotent Symmetric Fields and Spaces

A finite-dimensional B -space (Max-Times space) is, by definition, a subset X of R n + such that 0 ∈ X , for all t ≥ 0 and all x ∈ X , tx ∈ X and for all x, y ∈ X , x ∨ ty ∈ X .

We first define a suitable notion of idempotent pseudo-field . By comparing this definition with that of a field, note that we consider a weakened form of associativity and idempotence is added.

Definition 2.1.1 A triple ( K, /squareplus K , · K ) is an idempotent pseudo-field if:

- of associativity).

( a ) There exits a binary operation /squareplus K : K × K -→ K that satisfies the following properties: ( i ) for all λ ∈ K we have λ /squareplus K λ = λ (idempotence); ( ii ) for all ( λ, µ ) ∈ K × K we have λ /squareplus K µ = µ /squareplus K λ (commutativity); ( iii ) there exists a neutral element 0 K ∈ K such that λ /squareplus K 0 K = 0 K /squareplus K λ = λ for all λ ∈ K ; ( iv ) every λ ∈ K has a symmetric element -λ such that ( -λ ) /squareplus K λ = λ /squareplus K ( -λ ) = 0 X (symmetry); ( v ) for any mutually non-symmetric triple of elements ( λ, µ, η ) ∈ K 3 , ( λ /squareplus K µ ) /squareplus K η = λ /squareplus K ( µ /squareplus K η ) (weakened form

- ( b ) There exists a scalar multiplication · K : K × K -→ K that satisfies the following properties: ( i ) for all λ ∈ K and all ( λ, µ ) ∈ K × K , we have λ · K µ = µ · K λ (commutativity); ( ii ) for all λ, µ, η ∈ K × K × K we have ( λ · K µ ) · K η = λ · K ( µ · K η ) (associativity); ( iii ) there is an element 1 K ∈ K such that for all λ ∈ K we have 1 K · K λ = λ ; ( iv ) for all λ ∈ K \{ 0 K } there exists an element λ -1 such that λ · K λ -1 = 1 K .
- ( c ) The multiplication · K is distributive over the operation /squareplus K : for all λ ∈ K and all ( µ, ν ) ∈ K × K , we have

$$\lambda \cdot _ { K } ( \mu \, \mathbb { E } _ { K } \, \nu ) = ( \lambda \cdot _ { K } \mu ) \, \mathbb { E } _ { K } \, ( \lambda \cdot _ { K } \nu ) .$$

Example 2.1.2 From [8] , the triple ( R , /squareplus , · ) , where /squareplus is the binary operation defined in (6) is an idempotent pseudo-field.

In the following, when we use the /squareplus symbol without further specification on R n this will mean that we are considering the binary operation defined in equation (6) and its related n -ary extension.

Example 2.1.3 We consider the case of the non-associative symmetrisation of the Max-Plus semi-module analysed in [11]. Let M = R ∪ {-∞} and let us denote ( M , ⊕ , ⊗ ) the Maslov's semi-module where we replace the operations ∨ with ⊕ and + with ⊗ . More precisely one can define on M the operations ⊕ and ⊗ respectively as x ⊕ y = max { x, y } and x ⊗ y = x + y , where -∞ is the neutral element of the operation ⊕ .

Suppose now that x ∈ R -and let us extend the logarithm function to the whole set of real numbers. This we do by introducing the set

˜ M = M ∪ ( R +i π ) (33) where i is the complex number such that i 2 = -1 and R +i π = { x +i π : x ∈ R } . Note that this approach is not an extension to the complex numbers. In fact, it designates a copy of the real numbers. Note also that in [19], the authors propose a closely related construction, though not a symmetric one, by creating a copy of the real numbers. The formalism proposed in this paper is however convenient for introducing the following extended logarithmic function to ˜ M and transferring the algebraic structure of the real set. Let ψ ln : R -→ ˜ M be the map defined by:

The map x ↦→ ψ ln ( x ) is an isomorphism from R to ˜ M . Let ψ exp ( x ) : ˜ M -→ R be its inverse. Notice that ψ ln ( -1) = i π . By definition we have z ˜ /squareplus u = ψ ln ( ψ exp ( z ) /squareplus ψ exp ( u ) ) . Moreover, we have z ˜ ⊗ u = ψ ln ( ψ exp ( z ) ⊗ ψ exp ( u ) ) . It follows that ( ˜ M , ˜ ⊕ , ˜ ⊗ ) is isomorphic to ( R , /squareplus , · ) and is also an idempotent pseudofield with the neutral elements 0 ˜ M = -∞ and 1 ˜ M = 0 .

In Chapter 3 of [22] it was shown that Max-Plus algebra can also be viewed as a limit algebraic structure via the dequantization principle. For all z ∈ M n , let us denote:

From [11], it follows that for all z ∈ M n , we have

$$\ t h a t \text { for all } z \in \widetilde { \mathbb { M } } ^ { n } , \, w e \ h a v e \\ \underset { i \in [ n ] } { \widetilde { \text {zz} } } = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } \psi _ { \ln } ( \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } \psi _ { \exp } ( ( 2 p + 1 ) z _ { i } ) ) . \\ \text {we give another example, as in} \quad \intertext { s t h a t } \text {we give another example, as in} \quad \intertext { s t h a t } \text {we give another example, as in} \quad \intertext { s t h a t }$$

In the following, we give another example arising in a Min -Times context (see [1] for more details. )

Example 2.1.4 Let us define R -1 := R \{ 0 } ∪ {∞} . Let us consider the binary operation /squareplus -1 : R -1 × R -1 -→ R -1 defined as:

This operation is idempotent, has + ∞ as neutral element and is symmetric. Moreover, the standard product of non-zero numbers in R -1 satisfies the desired condition.

$$\text {define } \mathbb { R } ^ { - 1 } \colon = \mathbb { K } \langle \{ 0 \} \cup \{ \infty \} \colon \, \text {Let us consider the binary operation } \mathbb { I } ^ { - 1 } \colon \mathbb { R } ^ { - 1 } \times \\ \intertext { t a n t , h a s + \infty a n s e r t a l l e m e n t i v a n d i s y s u m m e t t i c .

Remark 2.1.5 In [31] , an idempotent algebraic structure was derived from a suitable dequantization principle defined over the complex scalar field. Let us consider the binary operation /squareplus C : C × C -→ C defined as:

It is easy to check that this operation is idempotent, has 0 as neutral element and is symmetric. Moreover, the standard product of complex numbers fulfils all the desired conditions. In addition note that this product is distributive over the operation /squareplus C . In particular, if | z | = | w | = ρ &gt; 0 then we have for all u ∈ C :

$$\begin{array} { c } \text {the complex scalar field.} \quad \text {let us consider the binary operation } \mathbb { E } _ { C } \colon \mathbb { C } \times \mathbb { C } \longrightarrow \mathbb { C } \text { defined} \\ \\ z \oplus \mathbb { E } _ { C } w = \begin{cases} z & \text {if} \quad | z | > | w | \\ w & \text {if} \quad | z | < | w | \\ 0 & \text {if} \quad z + w = 0 \\ \rho _ { | w | + w } ^ { \frac { 2 } { 2 } + w } & \text {if} \quad | z | = | w | = \rho > 0 . \\ \end{cases} \\ \intertext { t h a t h s i n d e r $ i s $ i n d e r $ i n d e r $ i s $ a n e u r t a l $ } \text {of complex numbers full} \quad \text {the desired conditions.} \ \text {in addition note that this product}$$

$$u \cdot ( z \, \mathbb { E } _ { \mathrm C } \, w ) = u \rho \frac { z + w } { | z + w | } = \rho \frac { u z + u w } { | z + w | } = \rho | u | \frac { u z + u w } { | u z + u w | } = ( u z ) \, \mathbb { E } _ { \mathrm C } \, ( u w ) . \\$$

However, it does not satisfy the weakened form of associativity of an idempotent pseudo-field.

Definition 2.1.6 A triple ( X, /squareplus X , · K ) is an idempotent symmetric space defined over a idempotent pseudofield K if:

( a ) There exits a binary operation /squareplus X : X × X -→ X that satisfies the following properties: ( i ) for all x ∈ X we have x /squareplus X x = x ; ( ii ) for all ( x, y ) ∈ X × X we have x /squareplus X y = y /squareplus X x ; ( iii ) there exists a neutral element 0 X ∈ X such that x /squareplus X 0 X = 0 X /squareplus X x for all x ∈ X ; ( iv ) every x ∈ X has a symmetric element -x such that ( -x ) /squareplus X x = x /squareplus X ( -x ) = 0 X .

( b ) There exists a scalar multiplication · K : R × X -→ X that satisfies the following properties: ( i ) for all λ ∈ R and all ( x, y ) ∈ X × X , we have λ · K ( x /squareplus X y ) = ( λ · K x ) /squareplus X ( λ · K y ) ; ( ii ) for all λ, µ ∈ R × R we have ( λ /squareplus K µ ) · K x = ( λ · K x ) /squareplus X ( µ · K x ) , ( iii ) for all λ, µ ∈ R × R we have ( λ · K µ ) · K x = λ · K ( µ · K x ) ; ( iv ) for all x ∈ X we have 1 · K x = x and -x = ( -1) · K x .

Suppose that X is an idempotent symmetric space. A subset Y of X is an idempotent symmetric subspace if for all x, y ∈ Y and all t ∈ R , x /squareplus X ty ∈ Y . Notice that, in this definition, associativity has been replaced with idempotence. Clearly, ( R , /squareplus , · ) is an idempotent symmetric space.

Lemma 2.1.7 Suppose that ( X, /squareplus X , · K ) is an idempotent symmetric space defined over an idempotent pseudo-field K . Then, for all x ∈ X , one has:

- ( b ) 0 K · K x = 0 X
- ( a ) λ · K 0 X = 0 X

Proof: ( a ) By definition, for all x ∈ X and all λ ∈ K , λ · K 0 X = λ · K ( x /squareplus X ( -x ) ) for all x ∈ X . Using axioms ( b 1 ), ( b 2 ) and ( b 4 ) yields λ · K 0 X = ( λ · K x ) /squareplus X ( λ · K ( -x )) = ( λ · K x ) /squareplus X ( λ · K ( -1) · K x ) ) = ( λ · K x ) /squareplus X ( ( -1) · K λ · K x ) ) = ( λ · K x ) /squareplus X ( -( λ · K x ) ) = 0 X . ( b ) We have for all x ∈ X , 0 K · K x = ( 1 K /squareplus ( -1 K ) ) x = (1 K · K x ) /squareplus X ( ( -1 K ) · K x ) = x /squareplus X ( -x ) = 0 X . ( c ) For all x, y ∈ X , ( ( -y ) /squareplus X ( -x ) ) /squareplus X ( x /squareplus X y ) = ( ( -1 K ) · K y /squareplus X ( -1 K ) · x ) /squareplus X ( x /squareplus X y ) = ( ( -1 K ) · ( y /squareplus X x ) ) /squareplus X ( x /squareplus X y ) = -( x /squareplus X y ) /squareplus X ( x /squareplus X y ) = 0 X . ✷

- ( c ) ( ( -y ) /squareplus X ( -x ) ) /squareplus X ( x /squareplus X y ) = 0 X .

Proposition 2.1.8 Let X be an idempotent symmetric space. The intersection of two idempotent symmetric subspaces of X is an idempotent symmetric subspace.

Example 2.1.9 ( R n , /squareplus , · ) is an idempotent symmetric space. Y = { ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ) ∈ R 4 : x 1 = x 2 , x 3 = x 4 } is an idempotent symmetric subspace of R 4 .

In the following, if K is an idempotent pseudo-field, we define the operations for all x, y ∈ K n and all λ ∈ K as follows:

$$x \mathbb { E } _ { K } \, y = ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } ) \, \mathbb { E } _ { K } \, ( y _ { 1 } , \dots , y _ { n } ) = ( x _ { 1 } \mathbb { E } _ { K } \, y _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } \, \mathbb { E } _ { K } \, y _ { n } )$$

and

$$\lambda \cdot _ { K } x & = \lambda \cdot _ { K } ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } ) = ( \lambda \cdot _ { K } x _ { 1 } , \dots , \lambda \cdot _ { K } x _ { n } ) . \\ \\ ,$$

The two following examples are based on this construction.

Example 2.1.10 ( ˜ M n , ˜ /squareplus , ˜ ⊗ ) is an idempotent symmetric space. Example 2.1.11 ( R -n , /squareplus -1 , · ) is an idempotent symmetric space, with R -n = ( R -1 ) n .

In the next example, it is shown that a similar construction can be applied to certain infinite-dimensional spaces.

Example 2.1.12 Suppose that I is a subset of R and let λ be the Lebesgue measure. Let L p ( λ ) be the set of the real valued maps f : I -→ R such that

$$\int _ { I } | f | ^ { p } d \lambda < + \infty$$

for p ∈ ]1 , + ∞ [ . Let us consider the binary operation defined over L p ( λ ) by:

Clearly, one has | f ( x ) /squareplus g ( x ) | ≤ | f ( x ) | + | g ( x ) | . It follows that

$$f \oplus & | 1 , + \infty | . \, \text {Let us consider } t \text { binary operation defined over } L _ { p } ( x ) \, \text {bys.} \\ & f \oplus \mathbb { B } \, g \colon x \mapsto f ( x ) \oplus g ( x ) = \begin{cases} f ( x ) & \text {if } \quad | f ( x ) | \ > \, | f ( y ) | \\ \frac { 1 } { f ( x ) } ( f ( x ) + f ( y ) ) & \text {if } \quad | f ( x ) | \ = \, | f ( y ) | \\ & \text {if } \quad | f ( x ) | \ < \, | f ( y ) | . \end{cases}$$

$$\int _ { I } | f \oplus | g | ^ { p } d \lambda & < \int _ { I } | f | ^ { p } d \lambda + \int _ { I } | g | ^ { p } d \lambda < \infty . \\ \intertext { s u r d w c t } \int _ { I } | f \oplus g | ^ { p } \, r e a l \, w a l w e d \ f u n c t i o n \ h y a r e a l \, s c a l a r . \ i t f o l l o w$$

Let · be the standard product of a real valued function by a real scalar, it follows that ( L p ( λ ) , /squareplus , · ) is an idempotent symmetric space.

Remark 2.1.13 Notice that that Examples 2.1.10 and 2.1.11 are constructed from an homeomorphic transformation of ( R n , /squareplus , · ) . It is therefore easy to define two convex structures on ( ˜ M n , ˜ /squareplus , ˜ ⊗ ) and ( R -n , /squareplus -1 , · ) respectively. Namely a subset M of ˜ M is M -convex if for all x, y ∈ M and all t ∈ M , x ˜ /squareplus ty ∈ C . Paralleling [1], a subset C of R -n is inverseB -convex if for all x, y ∈ C and all t ∈ [1 , + ∞ ] , x /squareplus -1 ty ∈ C.

The next result specifically concerns the algebraic structure considered in [8]. However it has some immediate implications for the idempotent symmetric spaces defined in examples 2.1.10 and 2.1.11.

Proposition 2.1.14 For all subsets Y of R n , the following claims are equivalent:

- ( a ) Y is an idempotent symmetric subspace of ( R n , /squareplus , · ) .

$$( b ) \ F o r \ a l l \ ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { m } ) \in Y ^ { m } \ a n d \ a l l \ t \in \mathbb { R } ^ { m } , \ w e \ h a v e \ \coprod _ { i \in [ m ] } t _ { i } x _ { i } \in Y .$$

Proof: Let us prove that ( a ) implies ( b ). If Y is an idempotent symmetric subspace, this property is true for m = 2. Suppose it is true at rank m and let us prove that it is true at rank m + 1. In other words, assume that for all ( x 1 , ..., x m ) ∈ Y m we have: /squareplus i ∈ [ m ] t i x i ∈ Y for all t ∈ R m , we need to prove that if ( x 1 , ..., x m , x m +1 ) ∈ Y m +1 then for all t ∈ R m +1 we have /squareplus i ∈ [ m +1] t i x i ∈ Y . To establish this property, we use equation (12) which implies that if ( x , ..., x , x ) Y m +1 then, for all t R m +1 , we have

$$\prod _ { i \in [ m + 1 ] } t _ { i } x _ { i } = \prod _ { i \in [ m + 1 ] } \left [ t _ { i } x _ { i } \oplus \left ( \prod _ { j \in [ m + 1 ] \ \{ i \} } t _ { j } x _ { j } \right ) \right ] . \quad ( ^ { * } )$$

1 m m +1 ∈ ∈

For all i , the vectors z i = t i x i /squareplus ( /squareplus j ∈ [ m +1] \{ i } t j x j ) are copositive. Thus the associativity holds true for the m -tuple ( z 1 , ..., z m ). However, since we assume that the property holds true at rank m , z i ∈ Y for all i . Thus we deduce that /squareplus i ∈ [ m +1] t i x i ∈ Y . Therefore, the first part of the proof is established. Since Y is a subset of R n , that is an idempotent symmetric space, the converse inclusion is immediate. ✷

The following property is an immediate consequence.

Proposition 2.1.15 Let Y be an idempotent symmetric subspace of ( R n , /squareplus , · ) . Then Y is idempotent symmetric convex.

## 2.2 Generalized Norms and Ultrametric in Limit.

Let ‖ · ‖ be the Euclidean norm defined for all x ∈ R n as ‖ x ‖ = ( ∑ i ∈ [ n ] x i 2 ) 1 2 . Let d be the Euclidean distance defined for all x, y ∈ R n as d ( x, y ) = ‖ x -y ‖ . For all positive natural numbers p , we introduce the map ‖ · ‖ ϕ p : R n -→ R + defined as

The following properties are immediate: ‖ x ‖ ϕ p = 0 ⇐⇒ x = 0; ‖ αx ‖ ϕ p = | α |‖ x ‖ ϕ p ; ‖ x p + y ‖ ϕ p ≤ ‖ x ‖ ϕ p p + ‖ y ‖ ϕ p . We deduce the following statements:

$$\left | x \right | _ { \varphi _ { p } } & = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \| \phi _ { p } ( x ) \| \right ) . \\ \intertext { l l } \text {miediate} \colon \left \| x \right \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } & = 0 \iff x = 0 ; \left \| \alpha x \right \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } = \left | \alpha \right | \| x \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } ; \left \| x \right \| _ { + } ^ { p } y \right \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \leq \| x \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \overset { p } { + }$$

Proposition 2.2.1 For all x, y ∈ R n and all α ∈ R , we have the the following properties:

- ( a ) ‖ x ‖ ∞ = lim p -→∞ ‖ x ‖ ϕ p ( b ) ‖ x /squareplus y ‖ ∞ ≤ max {‖ x ‖ ∞ , ‖ y ‖ ∞ } .

Proof: ( a ) For all x ∈ R n , we have

Proof: For all x ∈ R n , we have

For all i ∈ [ n ] and any natural number p , set z ( p ) i = ∣ ∣ ( x i 2 p +1 -y i 2 p +1 ) 1 2 p +1 ∣ ∣ 2 . For all i , we have: lim p -→∞ z ( p ) i = | x i /squareminus y i | 2 . Since for all p , z ( p ) i ≥ 0, it follows that

$$\| x \| _ { \wp _ { p } } = \left ( \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } | x _ { i } | ^ { 2 ( 2 p + 1 ) } \right ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 ( 2 p + 1 ) } } . \\$$

Taking the limit yields ( a ). ( b ) For all natural numbers p , we have:

$$\| x \, ^ { \, \frac { p } { \, } } y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \leq \| x \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \, ^ { \, \frac { p } { \, } } + \| y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } .$$

Suppose that { z ( p ) } p ∈ N is a sequence of R n + which converges to some z ∈ R n + . It follows that we have lim p -→∞ ‖ z ( p ) ‖ ϕ p = ‖ z ‖ ∞ . For all x ∈ R n , let us denote | x | = ( | x 1 | , ..., | x n | ). By definition, we have

$$\| x \, ^ { p } _ { + } y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } = \| | x \, ^ { p } _ { + } y | \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } .$$

Moreover, lim p -→∞ | x p + y | = | x /squareplus y | . It follows that:

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \| x ^ { \ p } + y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } = \| | x \mathbb { E } \, y | \| _ { \infty } = \| x \, \mathbb { E } \, y \| _ { \infty } .$$

Since ‖ x ‖ ϕ p ≥ 0 and ‖ y ‖ ϕ p ≥ 0, taking the limit on both sides in ( A ) yields the result. ✷

Recall that, for all α, β ∈ R , we adopt the notation α /squareminus β = α /squareplus ( -β ). Let us consider the map d /squareplus : R n × R n → R + defined as:

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) = \max _ { i \in [ n ] } | x _ { i } \, \Box \, y _ { i } |$$

In addition, let us consider the map d ϕ p : R n × R n -→ R + defined by:

$$d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( x , y ) = \| x \, \frac { p } { } \, y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } .$$

This function is a distance relative to the algebraic structure obtained from the binary operation p +. It defines a metric on any ϕ p -vector space. Note that d ϕ p is also a distance in the usual sense because as p ≥ 1, we have for all z ∈ R n the relation:

$$d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( x , y ) \leq d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( x , z ) \stackrel { p } { + } d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( z , y ) \leq d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( x , z ) + d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( z , y ) .$$

Lemma 2.2.2 For all x, y ∈ R n , we have

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( x , y ) = d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) .$$

$$\| x - y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } = \left ( \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } \left ( \left | ( x _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } - y _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } } \right | ^ { 2 } \right ) ^ { 2 p + 1 } \right ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 ( p + 1 ) } } . \\ \intertext { a n d a n y n a t r a l u n b e r p , s e t z _ { i } ^ { ( p ) } = \left | \left ( x _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } - y _ { i } ^ { 2 p + 1 } \right ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 p + 1 } } \right | ^ { 2 } . \text { For all } $ \real p \in \real p + 1 \right | ^ { 2 } . }$$

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \| x - \frac { p } { } \, y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } = \left ( \max _ { i \in [ n ] } | x _ { i } \, \Box \, y _ { i } | ^ { 2 } \right ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } = d _ { \mathbb { B } } ( x , y ) . \quad \Box$$

Proposition 2.2.3 The map d /squareplus : R n × R n -→ R + defines an ultrametric on R n . For all x, y, z ∈ R n :

- (1) d /squareplus ( x, y ) = d /squareplus ( y, x ) ;
- (2) d /squareplus ( x, y ) = 0 if and only if x = y ;
- (3) d /squareplus ( x, y ) ≤ max { d /squareplus ( x, z ) , d /squareplus ( z, y ) } .

Proof: (1) is immediate. (2) follows from the fact that for all i we have x i /squareminus y i = 0 ⇐⇒ x i = -y i . (3) For all x, y, z ∈ R n and for all natural numbers p , we have

$$d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( x ; y ) \leq d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( x , z ) \stackrel { p } { + } d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ( z , y ) .$$

Since for all x, y ∈ R n we have d ϕ p ( x, y ) ≥ 0 and lim p -→∞ d ϕ p ( x, y ) = d /squareplus ( x, y ), we deduce the result. ✷

Note that any ultrametric defines a metric since the inequality d ( x, y ) ≤ max { d ( x, z ) , d ( y, z ) } implies the triangular inequality d ( x, y ) ≤ d ( x, z ) + d ( y, z ). In particular for all x, y, z ∈ E , at least one of the three equalities d ( x, y ) = d ( y, z ) or d ( x, z ) = d ( y, z ) or d ( x, y ) = d ( z, x ) holds. From the above definition, one can conclude several typical properties of ultrametrics.

Proposition 2.2.4 Let Y be an idempotent symmetric subspace of R n . ( Y, d /squareplus ) is an ultrametric space.

Proof: Since Y is an idempotent symmetric space, the metric d /squareplus is well-defined on Y . From Proposition 2.2.3, the result is immediate. ✷

In the following we say that a sequence { x ( k ) } k ∈ N is Ϝ -convergent to x ∈ R n if lim k -→∞ d /squareplus ( x ( k ) , x ) = 0.

/negationslash

Lemma 2.2.5 Suppose that { x ( k ) } k ∈ N is Ϝ -convergent to x ∈ R n . Let I ( x ) = { i ∈ [ n ] : x i = 0 } . Then, there exists some natural number k 0 such that for all k ≥ k 0 and for all i ∈ I ( x ) we have x ( k ) i = x i . Moreover, for all i / ∈ I ( x ) , lim k -→∞ x ( k ) i = 0 .

/negationslash

Proof: Suppose that lim k -→∞ d /squareplus ( x ( k ) i , x ) = 0. Assume that there exits an increasing subsequence { k q } q ∈ N and some i 0 ∈ I ( x ) such that, for all q , x ( k q ) i = x i and let us show a contradiction. In such a case, for all q ∈ N , we have | x ( k q ) i 0 /squareminus x i 0 | = max {| x ( k q ) i 0 | , | x i 0 |} /negationslash = 0. This implies that

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x ^ { ( k _ { q } ) } , x ) = \max _ { i \in I ( x ) } \{ | x _ { i } ^ { ( k _ { q } ) } \, \exists \, x _ { i } | \} \geq | x _ { i _ { 0 } } ^ { ( k _ { q } ) } \, \exists \, x _ { i _ { 0 } } | = \max \{ | x _ { i _ { 0 } } ^ { ( k _ { q } ) } | , | x _ { i _ { 0 } } | \} > 0 ,$$

that is a contradiction. Hence, there is some k 0 such that for all k ≥ k 0 and for all i ∈ I ( x ) we have x ( k ) i = x i . If i / ∈ I ( x ) then | x ( k ) i /squareminus x i | = | x ( k ) i /squareminus 0 | = | x ( k ) i | and lim k -→∞ d /squareplus ( x ( k ) , x ) = 0. Therefore, lim k -→∞ x ( k ) i = 0. ✷

It is now interesting to see that the idempotent symmetrized space ( ˜ M n , ˜ /squareplus , ˜ ⊗ ) can also be endowed with a suitable form of ultrametric. Let d ˜ /squareplus : ˜ M n × ˜ M n -→ R ∪ {-∞} defined as:

where for all γ ∈ ˜ M , | γ ∣ ∣ ˜ M = ψ ln ( | ψ exp ( γ ) | ) and, for all i , z i ˜ /squareminus w i = ψ ln ( ψ exp ( z i ) /squareminus ψ exp ( w i ) ) . It is therefore easy to check that: ( i ) for all ( z, w ) ∈ ˜ M n × ˜ M n , d ˜ /squareplus ( z, w ) = -∞ ⇐⇒ z = w ; ( ii ) for all z, t, w ∈ ˜ M n , d ˜ /squareplus ( z, w ) ≤ max { d ˜ /squareplus ( z, t ) , d ˜ /squareplus ( t, w ) } . Therefore, paralleling Proposition 2.2.4, ( ˜ M , ˜ /squareplus , ˜ ⊗ ) can also be endowed with a topological structure. In particular, we can construct a standard ultrametric by defining for all z, w ∈ ˜ M n the distance ¯ d ˜ /squareplus ( z, w ) = ψ exp ( d ˜ /squareplus ( z, w ) ) .

Proposition 2.2.6 Let Z be an idempotent symmetric subspace of ˜ M n . Then ( Z, ¯ d ˜ /squareplus ) is an ultrametric space.

## 2.3 Geometry of the Ultrametric Ball

In the following, let B /squareplus ( x, r ) = { z ∈ R n : d /squareplus ( x, z ) &lt;r } and B /squareplus ( x, r ] = { z ∈ R n : d /squareplus ( x, z ) ≤ r } respectively denote the open and closed balls centered at x with radius r .

For all x ∈ R n and all subsets I of [ n ], let us consider the map A x : I -→ R + defined for all i ∈ I by A x ( i ) = | x i | . This map associates to each index i the absolute value of the i -th coordinate of x . For all α ∈ R + , A -1 x ( α ) = { i ∈ I : | x i | = α } .

L ( x, y ) is obtained by dropping from [ n ] all the i 's such that x i = y i . It follows that d /squareplus ( x, y ) = 0 if x = y and

Proof: ( i ) is immediate. ( ii ) If α = 0, then B /squareplus ( x, 0 ] = { x } . If α 1 = 0, the case α &lt; α 1 is then excluded. Suppose that α 1 &gt; 0 . For all z = x , max i ∈ [ n ] | x i /squareplus ( -z i ) | ≥ max i ∈ [ n ] | x i | ≥ α 1 . Therefore α &lt; α 1 implies that B /squareplus ( x, α ] = { x } . ( iii ) Suppose that α ∈ [ α 1 , α 2 ]. If there is some i ∈ A -1 x ( [ α 2 , α m ] ) such that z i = x i , then d /squareplus ( x, z ) ≥ α 2 &gt; α 1 . Therefore, if z ∈ B /squareplus ( x, 0 ] we should have z i = x i for all i ∈ A -1 x ( [ α 2 , α m ] ) . Moreover, for all i ∈ A -1 x ( { α 1 } ) we should have | z i | ≤ α. Let us extend this result to some arbitrary j ≤ m -1. Suppose that α ∈ [ α j , α j +1 ]. If there is some i ∈ A -1 x ( [ α j +1 , α m ] ) such that z i = x i , then d /squareplus ( x, z ) ≥ α j +1 &gt; α j . Therefore, if z ∈ B /squareplus ( x, α ], we should have z i = x i for all i ∈ A -1 x ( [ α j +1 , α m ] ) . Moreover, for all i ∈ A -1 x ( [ α 1 , α j ] ) we should have | z i | ≤ α. ( iv ) Suppose now that α ≥ ‖ x ‖ ∞ . By construction α m = ‖ x ‖ ∞ and z ∈ B /squareplus ( x, α ] if and only if | z i | ≤ ‖ x ‖ ∞ , which ends the proof. ✷

Corollary 2.3.2 For all α ≥ 0 , and all x ∈ R n , B /squareplus ( x, α ] is closed with respect to the norm topology.

Proof: Let A x ( [ n ] ) = { α j } j ∈ [ m ] with α j &lt; α j +1 for all j ∈ [ m -1] and α j ≥ 0 for all j . The result is immediate if either α = 0 or α ∈ [0 , α 1 [ since B /squareplus ( x, α ] = { x } . From Proposition 2.3.1, if α ∈ [ α j , α j +1 [, then

Since the intersection of two closed sets is a closed set, we deduce that B /squareplus ( x, α ] is closed. If α ≥ ‖ x ‖ ∞ , the result is immediate. ✷

Corollary 2.3.3 For all α ≥ 0 , and all x ∈ R n , B /squareplus ( x, α ] is idempotent symmetric convex.

Proof: From Proposition 2.3.1, B /squareplus ( x, α ] is the cartesian product between a box and a singleton. Since any box is idempotent symmetric convex, the result immediately follows. ✷

In [8] the following formulation of a B -polytope was established in the case of two points. 4 For all x, y ∈ R n ,

In classical convexity, counting the same point twice in a finite set does not alter its convex hull. However, this is not the case here due to the specific properties of the non-associative operation we consider. This formulation is useful to prove the next decomposition result over ( R n , /squareplus , · ).

$$\in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } , \\ C o ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) = \left \{ t x \oplus r x \oplus s y \oplus w y \colon \max \{ t , r , s , w \} = 1 , t , r , s , w \geq 0 \right \} . \\ \\ \text {classical convexity, counting the same point twice in a finite set does not alter its convex hull. However,}$$

Proposition 2.3.4 For all x, y ∈ R n , and all z ∈ Co ∞ ( x, y ) we have:

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) = \max \{ d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , z ) , d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( z , y ) \} .$$

/negationslash

Proof: If x = y , then the result is immediate. Let us assume that x = y . Suppose that z ∈ Co ∞ ( x, y ), in such a case there are some r, s, t, w ∈ [0 , 1] with max { r, s, t, w } = 1 such that

$$z = r x \oplus s x \oplus t y \oplus w y .$$

Suppose that α = d /squareplus ( x, y ). Let L ( x, y ) = { i ∈ [ n ] : x i = y i } . By construction

/negationslash

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) = \max \{ | x _ { i } | , | y _ { i } | \colon i \in \mathcal { L } ( x , y ) \} .$$

Therefore, for all i / ∈ L ( x, y ), if | x i | &gt; d /squareplus ( x, y ) then x i = y i . Thus, we deduce that z i = rx i /squareplus sx i /squareplus ty i /squareplus wy i = x i = y i . It follows that x i /squareminus z i = y i /squareminus z i = 0. Hence, we have:

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , z ) = \max \{ | x _ { i } \, \mathbb { E } \, z _ { i } | \, \colon i \in \mathcal { L } ( x , y ) \}$$

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( y , z ) = \max \{ | y _ { i } \, \mathbb { E } \, z _ { i } | \, \colon i \in \mathcal { L } ( x , y ) \} .$$

$$| z _ { i } | = | r x _ { i } \oplus s x _ { i } \oplus t y _ { i } \oplus w y _ { i } | \leq \max \{ | x _ { i } | , | y _ { i } | \}$$

4 We use the convention that for all ( α, β, γ, δ ) ∈ R 4 , α /squareplus β /squareplus γ /squareplus δ = Ϝ [4] ( α, β, γ, δ ).

Since, for all i , | x i /squareminus z i | ≤ max {| x i | , | y i |} and | y i /squareminus z i | ≤ max {| x i | , | y i |} , we deduce that

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , z ) \leq \max \{ | x _ { i } | , | y _ { i } | \colon i \in \mathcal { L } ( x , y ) \} = d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y )$$

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( y , z ) \leq \max \{ | x _ { i } | , | y _ { i } | \colon i \in \mathcal { L } ( x , y ) \} = d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) .$$

$$\max \{ d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , z ) , d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( z , y ) \} & \leq d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) . \\$$

However, from the triangular inequality, we have

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) \leq \max \{ d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , z ) , d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( z , y ) \} .$$

Since the converse inequality holds, this completes the proof. ✷

The next result is an immediate consequence.

Proposition 2.3.5 Let A = { x (1) , ..., x ( m ) } be a finite subset of R n . Suppose moreover that ( i ) Co ∞ ( x (1) , x ( m ) ) = ⋃ i ∈ [ m -1] Co ∞ ( x ( i ) , x ( i +1) ) ; ( ii ) for all i Co ∞ ( x ( i -1) , x ( i ) ) ∩ Co ∞ ( x ( i ) , x ( i +1) ) = { x ( i ) } . Then we have:

Proof: Since x (2) ∈ Co ∞ ( x (1) , x ( m ) ) , we have:

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x ^ { ( 1 ) } , x ^ { ( m ) } ) = \max _ { i \in [ m - 1 ] } d _ { \mathbb { E } } \left ( x ^ { ( i ) } , x ^ { ( i + 1 ) } \right ) . \\ r ( 1 ) \ r ( m ) \right ) \ W e h a v e \colon$$

$$d _ { \oplus } ( x ^ { ( 1 ) } , x ^ { ( m ) } ) & = \max \left \{ d _ { \oplus } ( x ^ { ( 1 ) } , x ^ { ( 2 ) } ) , d _ { \oplus } ( x ^ { ( 2 ) } , x ^ { ( m ) } ) \right \} . \\ \intertext { s o n t i o n p r e t y } \text { position property established in } \left [ 1 \right ] , \text { we have } C o ^ { \infty } ( x ^ { ( k ) } , x ^ { ( m ) } ) \, = \, C o ^ { \circ }$$

$$j \colon \text {Proofs} \, \{ s \text { made } h \in [ h ^ { ( k ) } , x ^ { ( k ) } , x ^ { ( k + 1 ) } ) , d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x ^ { ( k ) } , x ^ { ( k + 1 ) } , x ^ { ( m ) } ) \} . \\ d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x ^ { ( k ) } , x ^ { ( m ) } ) = \max \left \{ d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x ^ { ( k ) } , x ^ { ( k + 1 ) } ) , d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x ^ { ( k + 1 ) } , x ^ { ( m ) } ) \right \} . \\ \intertext { t h e r o f o r s i n t h e m i d i a t e . }$$

From the decomposition property established in [10], we have Co ∞ ( x ( k ) , x ( m ) ) = Co ∞ ( x ( k ) , x ( k +1) ) ∪ Co ∞ ( x ( k +1) , x ( m ) ). It follows that for any k ∈ [ m -1], x ( k +1) ∈ Co ∞ ( x ( k ) , x ( m ) ) . Hence:

By recurrence the proof is then immediate. ✷

Proposition 2.3.6 Let x, y ∈ R n . If x = -y , then for all z ∈ Co ∞ ( x, y ) \{ x, y } , d /squareplus ( x, y ) = d /squareplus ( x, z ) = d /squareplus ( z, y ) .

Proof: Suppose that z ∈ Co ∞ ( x, y ), in such a case there are some r, s, t, w ∈ [0 , 1] with max { r, s, t, w } = 1 such that z = rx /squareplus sx /squareplus ty /squareplus wy. Since z / ∈ { x, y } we have max { r, s } = max { t, w } = 1, and min { r, s } = max { t, w } = 1, otherwise either z = x or z = y . If r = s = t = w = 1, then z = 0 and the result is immediate. Consequently max { r, s } = max { t, w } = 1, min { r, s } &lt; 1 and min { t, w } &lt; 1. Dropping the symmetric terms, it follows that

$$z & = r x \, \mathbb { E } \, s x \, \mathbb { E } \, t y \, \mathbb { E } \, w y = \min \{ r , s \} x \, \mathbb { E } \, \min \{ t , w \} y . \\ \intertext { t } \mathbb { \ } ( \mathbf a ) \, \{ \mathbf a - ( \mathbf a ) ^ { 2 } \} & = \mathbf a + 1 \, ( \mathbf a ) ^ { 2 } \, \mathbf a - 1 \, ( \mathbf a ) ^ { 2 } \, ( \mathbf a ) ^ { 2 } \, ( \mathbf a ) ^ { 2 } \, ( \mathbf a ) ^ { 2 }$$

Since min { r, s } &lt; 1 and min { t, w } &lt; 1, this implies that d /squareplus ( x, y ) = d /squareplus ( x, z ) = d /squareplus ( z, y ) . ✷

## 3 Some Trigonometric Properties in Limit

In this section, we show that certain properties related to the notion of orthogonality can be derived within the framework of the idempotent and symmetric algebraic structure we consider.

and

Thus

## 3.1 Orthogonality and Pythagorean Properties in Limit

In the following, for all p ∈ N , we say that x, y ∈ R n are ϕ p -orthogonal if:

$$\langle x , y \rangle _ { p } = 0 . \\$$

In addition, we say that x, y ∈ R n are Ϝ -orthogonal if:

$$\langle x , y \rangle _ { \infty } = 0 . \\$$

In the sequel, the earlier results are extended to the general case of a triple [ x, y, z ] of R n . Notice that we have for all natural numbers p

$$\langle x ^ { \frac { p } { 2 } } z , y ^ { \frac { p } { 2 } } z \rangle _ { p } = & \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } x _ { i } y _ { i } + \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } ^ { \varphi _ { p } } \left ( - x _ { i } z _ { i } \right ) ^ { \frac { p } { p } } + \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } ^ { \varphi _ { p } } \left ( - y _ { i } z _ { i } \right ) + \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } ^ { \varphi _ { p } } z _ { i } ^ { 2 } . \\ \intertext { f o r e }$$

Therefore:

$$& \quad \lim _ { p \to \infty } \langle x ^ { \ p } - z , y ^ { \underline { \ p } } - z \rangle _ { p } = F _ { [ 4 n ] } ( x _ { 1 } y _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } y _ { n } , - x _ { 1 } z _ { 1 } , \dots , - x _ { n } z _ { n } , - y _ { 1 } z _ { 1 } , \dots , - y _ { n } z _ { n } , z _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } , \dots , z _ { n } ^ { 2 } ) . \\ & \quad \text {In the following, we introduce the operation } \langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle _ { \mathbb { E } } \colon \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \times \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \times \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \longrightarrow \mathbb { R } \text { defined as} \colon$$

In the following, we introduce the operation 〈 〈· , · , ·〉 〉 /squareplus : R n × R n × R n -→ R defined as:

$$\langle ( x , y , z ) _ { \infty } = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \langle x - z , y - z \rangle _ { p } . \\ \text {all } x , y , z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } , \text { we say that } [ x , y , z ] \text { is } F \text {-right-aligned in } z \text { if }$$

In the following, for all x, y, z R n , we say that [ x, y, z ] is Ϝ -right-angled in z if

$$\langle \langle x , y , z \rangle \rangle _ { \infty } = 0 . \\$$

In general, a right-angled triangle is not a Ϝ -right-angled triple. This is shown in the next example.

Example 3.1.1 Let x = (1 , -2 , -1) , y = (2 , 3 , -2) and z = (3 , 2 , -3) . We have x -z = ( -2 , -4 , 2) and y -z = ( -1 , 1 , 1) . We have 〈 x -z, y -z 〉 = 0 . Therefore [ x, y, z ] is a right-angled triangle.However Ϝ [12] (2 , -6 , 2 , 3 , 2 , -3 , -6 , -6 , -6 , 9 , 4 , 9) = 9 = 0 . Hence [ x, y, z ] is not a Ϝ -right-angled triple.

/negationslash

The next result was established in [10]. It plays an important role in the remainder. It means that if the limit sum is zero then the φ p -generalized sum is zero for any p .

$$& \text {Lemma 3.1.2 } \ \text {suppose that there is some } x = ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } ) \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \text { such that } \bigoplus _ { i \in [ n ] } x _ { i } = 0 . \text { Then for all } \\ & p \in N , \sum _ { i \in [ n ] } x _ { i } = 0 . \\ & \text {Proposition 3.1.3. Let x , y , z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } , and let [ x , y , z ] \ be a triple . The triple [ x , y , z ] \ is F - r i g h t - a n g l e d \ in z \ all \\ & \text {if } \quad 1 - \lim _ { \ } i \in \{ f \} \ \in \mathbb { N } \ \{ \begin{array} { c } 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \} \quad \colon \quad \colon \quad \colon \quad 1 , \quad 1 , \quad \colon \quad \colon \quad 0 , \quad 1 , \quad 0 , \quad 0 , \quad 1 , \quad 0 \\$$

Proposition 3.1.3 Let x, y, z ∈ R n , and let [ x, y, z ] be a triple. The triple [ x, y, z ] is Ϝ -right-angled in z all if and only if for all p ∈ N , [ x, y, z ] is ϕ p -right-angled in z , i.e. 〈 x p -z, y p -z 〉 p = 0 . Proof: If [ x, y, z ] is a Ϝ -right-angled triple in z then:

It follows that

$$\langle \langle x , y , z \rangle _ { \infty } = 0 .$$

$$\langle x - z , y - z \rangle _ { p } = 0$$

Conversely if for all p , [ x, y, z ] is a ϕ p -right-angled triple in z , then for all p for all p ∈ N and the first implication follows.

Hence which proves the reciprocal. ✷

$$\langle x - z , y - z \rangle _ { p } = 0 . \\$$

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \left \langle x - z , y - z \right \rangle _ { p } = \left \langle \left \langle x , y , z \right \rangle \right \rangle _ { \infty } = 0 ,$$

Remark 3.1.4 A Ϝ -right-angled triple is a right-angled triangle. However, the converse is not true. In Figure 4, [ a, b, c ] is right-angled but not Ϝ -right-angled. The triples [ d, f, e ] and [ g, 0 , h ] are Ϝ -right-angled.

In Figure 5, the same triples are represented using idempotent symmetric convex lines. Clearly, the right angle is preserved only for the triples [ d, f, e ] and [ g, 0 , h ] .

In the following, for all subsets I of [ n ] and all x ∈ R n , let us denote x [ I ] = ∑ i ∈ I x i e i , where { e 1 , ..., e n } is the canonic basis of R n .

Proposition 3.1.5 Let x, y, z ∈ R n , and let [ x, y, 0] is a Ϝ -right-angled triple in 0 . Then there exists a partition { I 1 , ..., I m , J } of [ n ] with m = /floorleft n 2 /floorright , Card( J ) ∈ { 0 , 1 } and such that for all k :

is a right-angled triangle in 0 [ I k ] of R I k with Card( I k ) = 2 . Moreover, if J = { j } is nonempty then x j y j = 0 .

$$\left [ x _ { [ I _ { k } ] } , y _ { [ I _ { k } ] } , 0 _ { [ I _ { k } ] } \right ]$$

Proof: If [ x, y, 0] is a Ϝ -right-angled triple in 0 then:

$$\prod _ { i \in [ n ] } x _ { i } y _ { i } = 0 .$$

/squareplus i ∈ [ n ] x i y i = 0 implies that there exists a partition { I 1 , ..., I m , J } of [ n ] with m = /floorleft n 2 /floorright , Card( I k ) = 2 for all k and Card( J ) ∈ { 0 , 1 } such that:

$$\sum _ { i \in [ I _ { k } ] } x _ { i } y _ { i } = \prod _ { i \in [ I _ { k } ] } x _ { i } y _ { i } = 0 ,$$

and x j y j = 0 if J = { j } is a nonempty set. Consequently

Suppose that I k = { i ′ , i ′′ } . Then

$$x _ { i ^ { \prime } } y _ { i ^ { \prime } } \, \Xi \{ x _ { i ^ { \prime \prime } } y _ { i ^ { \prime \prime } } = 0 \iff x _ { i ^ { \prime } } y _ { i ^ { \prime } } - x _ { i ^ { \prime \prime } } y _ { i ^ { \prime \prime } } = 0 .$$

It follows that 〈 x [ I k ] , y [ I k ] 〉 p = 0 for all p. ✷

Corollary 3.1.6 Suppose that n = 2 . If [ x, y, 0] is a right-angled triangle in z of R 2 , then [ x, y, 0] is Ϝ -right-angled in 0 and it is ϕ p -right-angled in 0 for all natural numbers p .

The following result is an idempotent and non-associative analogue of the Pythagorean theorem.

$$\sum _ { i \in [ I _ { k } ] } x _ { i } y _ { i } = 0 .$$

Proposition 3.1.7 Let x, y, z ∈ R n , and let [ x, y, z ] is a Ϝ -right-angled triple in z . Then for all p ∈ N :

$$d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( x ; y ) = d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( x , z ) \, \stackrel { p } { + } d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( y , z ) ,$$

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , y ) = \max \{ d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( x , z ) , d _ { \mathbb { E } } ( y , z ) \} .$$

Proof: If [ x, y, z ] is a Ϝ -right-angled triple in z then

$$\langle \langle x , y , z \rangle _ { \infty } = 0 .$$

Thus, for all p , 〈 x p -z, y p -z 〉 p = 0. It follows that

$$\langle \phi _ { p } ( x ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) \rangle = 0 .$$

$$\| \phi _ { p } ( x ) - \phi _ { p } ( y ) \| ^ { 2 } = \| \phi _ { p } ( x ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) \| ^ { 2 } + \| \phi _ { p } ( y ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) \| ^ { 2 } .$$

Hence

We deduce that

$$\left \| \phi _ { p } \left ( \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) - \phi _ { p } ( y ) ) \right ) \right \| ^ { 2 } & = \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \| \phi _ { p } ( \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) ) \| ^ { 2 } ) + \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \| \phi _ { p } ( \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \phi _ { p } ( y ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) ) \| ^ { 2 } ) \right ) . \\ \intertext { T h u s \colon } \left \| \phi _ { p } \right \| ^ { 2 } \left ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) - \phi _ { p } ( y ) \right ) & \right \| ^ { 2 } & = \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \| \phi _ { p } ( \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) ) \| ^ { 2 } ) + \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \| \phi _ { p } ( \phi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \phi _ { p } ( y ) - \phi _ { p } ( z ) ) \| ^ { 2 } ) \right ) . \\$$

$$d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( x , y ) = \| x \, \frac { p } { } - y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } = \| x \, \frac { p } { } \, z \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \, + \| y \, \frac { p } { } \, z \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } = d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( x , z ) \, + d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( y , z ) .$$

Thus:

Taking the limit, yields:

$$d _ { \mathbb { E } } ^ { 2 } ( x , y ) = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( x , y ) = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( x , z ) \stackrel { p } { + } d _ { \varphi _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ( y , z ) = \max \{ d _ { \mathbb { E } } ^ { 2 } ( x , z ) , d _ { \mathbb { E } } ^ { 2 } ( y , z ) \} .$$

The final statement immediately follows. ✷

## 3.2 Cosine, Sine in Limit and some Parametrization of the Unit Square

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that we can use the limiting properties of standard trigonometric concepts to derive analogues of well-known geometric properties within the framework of the non-associative algebra we are studying. Paralleling the usual definition of a cosine, let us define the ϕ p -pseudo-cosine of the angle between two vectors as:

$$\cos _ { p } ( x , y ) = \frac { \langle x , y \rangle _ { p } } { \| x \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \| y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } } . \\$$

Taking the limit, we define the pseudo Ϝ -cosine as:

$$\cos _ { \infty } ( x , y ) = \frac { \langle x , y \rangle _ { \infty } } { \| x \| _ { \infty } \| y \| _ { \infty } } . \\ \\$$

It is now natural to define a sine function in limit. In [11] a ϕ p exterior product is defined for all v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n ∈ R n as:

where:

$$\in \mathbb { K } ^ { n } \text { as} \colon & & ( v _ { 1 } \stackrel { p } { \wedge } v _ { 2 } \stackrel { p } { \wedge } \dots \stackrel { p } { \wedge } v _ { n } ) = | v _ { 1 } , v _ { 2 } , \dots , v _ { n } | _ { p } ( e _ { 1 } / \widehat { e } _ { 2 } \wedge \dots \wedge e _ { n } ) ,$$

$$( v _ { 1 } \stackrel { p } { \wedge } v _ { 2 } \stackrel { p } { \wedge } , \dots , \stackrel { p } { \wedge } v _ { n } ) & = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 1 } ) \wedge \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 2 } ) \wedge \dots \wedge \phi _ { p } ( v _ { n } ) \, ) \\ & = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( | \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 1 } ) , \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 2 } ) , \dots , \phi _ { p } ( v _ { n } ) | \right ) ( e _ { 1 } \wedge e _ { 2 } \wedge \dots \wedge e _ { n } ) .$$

Taking the limit yields:

$$\wedge \dots \wedge v _ { n } ) & = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 1 } ) \wedge \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 2 } ) \wedge \dots \wedge \phi _ { p } ( v _ { n } ) \right ) \\ & = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( | \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 1 } ) , \phi _ { p } ( v _ { 2 } ) , \dots , \phi _ { p } ( v _ { n } ) | \right ) ( e _ { 1 } \wedge e _ { 2 } \wedge \dots \wedge e _ { n } ) .$$

$$( v _ { 1 } \stackrel { \infty } { \wedge } v _ { 2 } \stackrel { \infty } { \wedge } \dots \stackrel { \infty } { \wedge } v _ { n } ) = | v _ { 1 } , v _ { 2 } , \dots , v _ { n } | _ { \infty } ( e _ { 1 } \stackrel { \infty } { \wedge } e _ { 2 } \stackrel { \infty } { \wedge } \dots \stackrel { \infty } { \wedge } e _ { n } ) .$$

and

In the case of two vectors the exterior product can be identified to the exterior product and the oriented area of the cross product can be interpreted as the positive area of the parallelogram having x and y as sides:

$$x \wedge y = | x , y | = \| x \| \, \| y \| \sin ( x , y ) .$$

The ϕ p -sine function for two vectors x, y ∈ R 2 is defined as

$$\varphi ^ { 1 } ( x , y ) = \frac { | x , y | _ { p } } { \| x \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \| y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } } = \frac { \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \varphi _ { p } ( x _ { 1 } ) \varphi _ { p } ( y _ { 2 } ) - \varphi _ { p } ( x _ { 2 } ) \varphi _ { p } ( y _ { 1 } ) ) } { \| x \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \| y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } } .$$

Along this line, let us define

$$\sin _ { \infty } ( x , y ) = \frac { | x , y | _ { \infty } } { \| x \| _ { \infty } \| y \| _ { \infty } } = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \sin _ { p } ( x , y ) = \frac { x _ { 1 } y _ { 2 } \, \Box \, \exists \, x _ { 2 } y _ { 1 } } { \max \{ | x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } | \} \, \max \{ | y _ { 1 } , y _ { 2 } | \} } .$$

Proof: ( a ) The first statement is immediate. To prove the second part note that:

$$\sin _ { p } ( x , y ) = \frac { | x , y | _ { p } } { \| x \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } \| y \| _ { \varphi _ { p } } } = \frac { \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( | \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) | \right ) } { \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \| \phi _ { p } ( x ) \| ) \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \| \phi _ { p } ( y ) \| ) } .$$

$$\sin _ { p } ( x , y ) = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \frac { | \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) | } { \| \phi _ { p } ( x ) \| \| \phi _ { p } ( y ) \| } \right ) = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \sin ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) ) \right ) .$$

Therefore

( b ) We have

$$( b ) \, \text { we have} \\ \cos _ { p } ( x , y ) ^ { 2 } + \sin _ { p } ( x , y ) ^ { 2 } & = \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \cos \left ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) \right ) ) ^ { 2 } \right ) + \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \sin \left ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) \right ) ) ^ { 2 } \right ) \\ & = \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } [ ( \cos \left ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) \right ) ) ^ { 2 } ] \right ) + \varphi _ { p } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } [ ( \sin \left ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) \right ) ) ^ { 2 } \right ) \\ & = ( \cos \left ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) \right ) ) ^ { 2 } + ( \sin \left ( \phi _ { p } ( x ) , \phi _ { p } ( y ) \right ) ) ^ { 2 } = 1 . \\$$

( c ) From ( a ) and ( b ), we have

$$\max \{ | \cos _ { \infty } ( x , y ) | ^ { 2 } , | \sin _ { \infty } ( x , y ) | ^ { 2 } \} = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \cos _ { p } ( x , y ) ^ { 2 } \stackrel { p } { + } \sin _ { p } ( x , y ) ^ { 2 } = 1 .$$

Therefore,

$$\max \{ | \cos _ { \infty } ( x , y ) | , | \sin _ { \infty } ( x , y ) | \} = 1 . \ \square$$

Let C ∞ (0 , 1] = { ( x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ R 2 : max {| x 1 | , | x 2 |} = 1 } be the circle defined with respect to the ‖ ‖ ∞ metric in R 2 . Let us consider the points a = (1 , 0), b = (1 , 1), c = (0 , 1), d = ( -1 , 1), e = ( -1 , 0), f = ( -1 , -1), g = (0 , -1), h = (1 , -1). By construction:

$$C _ { \infty } ( 0 , 1 ) = C _ { \mathbb { H } } ( 0 , 1 ) = [ a , b ] \cup [ b , d ] \cup [ d , f ] \cup [ f , h ] \cup [ h , a ] .$$

In the following we will identify the angles of the square with the length of the segments of its circumference. Let us consider the map α : C ∞ (0 , 1] -→ [0 , 8] defined by:

Clearly, we have α ( a ) = 0, α ( b ) = 1, α ( c ) = 2, α ( d ) = 3, α ( e ) = 4, α ( f ) = 5, α ( g ) = 6, α ( h ) = 7 .

It is easy to prove that this map is a bijection from C ∞ (0 , 1] to [0 , 8]. Notice that 8 is the perimeter of C ∞ (0 , 1]. For all θ ∈ [0 , 8] we define the pseudo-cosine pcos : R -→ [ -1 , 1] as a periodic function with period 8:

$$& \text {er the map } \alpha \colon C _ { \infty } ( 0 , 1 ] \longrightarrow [ 0 , 8 ] \text { defined by:} \\ & \quad \begin{cases} x _ { 2 } & \text {if} \quad x \in [ a , b ] \\ 2 - x _ { 1 } & \text {if} \quad x \in [ b , d ] \\ 4 - x _ { 2 } & \text {if} \quad x \in [ d , f ] . \end{cases} \\ & = \begin{cases} 0 , \alpha ( b ) = 1 , \alpha ( c ) = 2 , \alpha ( d ) = 3 , \alpha ( e ) = 4 , \alpha ( f ) = 5 , \alpha ( g ) = 6 , \alpha ( h ) = 7 . \\ \text {that this map is a bijection from } C _ { \infty } ( 0 , 1 ] \text { to } [ 0 , 8 ] . \text { Notice that } 8 \text { is the perimeter of } 0 \\ 8 0 \, \text {el} \, \text {a} \, \text {pseudo-conosime} \, \rho \cos ^ { 2 } \colon \mathbb { P } \longrightarrow [ - 1 , 1 ] \text { as a periodic function with period } 2 \end{cases}$$

$$\ p { \cos ( \theta ) } = c \cos _ { \infty } \left ( \alpha ^ { - 1 } ( \theta ) , e _ { 1 } \right ) \quad \mod 8 .$$

$$\begin{array} { c } \text {any integer } k \in \mathbb { Z } \\ \\ \\ \ p \cos ( \theta + 8 k ) = \begin{cases} & 1 \quad \text {if} \quad \theta \in [ 0 , 1 ] \\ & 2 - \theta \quad \text {if} \quad \theta \in [ 1 , 3 ] \\ & - 1 \quad \text {if} \quad \theta \in [ 3 , 5 ] \ . \end{cases} \\ & \quad \begin{cases} & - 6 + \theta \quad \text {if} \quad \theta \in [ 5 , 7 ] \\ & 1 \quad \text {if} \quad \theta \in [ 7 , 8 ] \end{cases} \\ & \quad + 1 \uparrow \\ & \quad \end{array}$$

It follows that for any integer k ∈ Z

Parallel to the previous definition, for all θ ∈ [0 , 8], we define the pseudo-sine function psin : R -→ [ -1 , 1] as a periodic function with period 8:

$$\ p s i ( \theta ) = \sin _ { \infty } \left ( \alpha ^ { - 1 } ( \theta ) , e _ { 1 } \right ) \quad \mod 8 .$$

We can continue the previous analogies, this time using complex numbers and studying the relative properties of the unit square. Let us denote C ϕ p (0 , 1] = { x ∈ R n : ‖ x ‖ ϕ p = 1 } . We have the relations φ p ( C ϕ p (0 , 1] ) = C (0 , 1]. Now, let us consider the subsets of C defined as C /natural ϕ p (0 , 1] = { z = a +i b ∈ C : ‖ ( a, b ) ‖ ϕ p = 1 } and C /natural ∞ (0 , 1] = { z = a +i b ∈ C : ‖ ( a, b ) ‖ ∞ = 1 } . Let us consider the bijective map ϕ /natural : C -→ C defined as:

$$\varphi _ { p } ^ { \natural } ( a + i b ) = \varphi _ { p } ( a ) + i \varphi _ { p } ( b ) .$$

Its reciprocal is the map ϕ /natural -1 : C -→ C defined as ϕ /natural p -1 ( a + i b ) = ϕ -1 p ( a ) + i ϕ -1 p ( b ) . The map ϕ /natural p is homogeneous with respect to the real scalar field, i.e. for all ρ ∈ R , ϕ /natural p ( ρ ( a + i b ) ) = ρ ( ϕ p ( a ) + i ϕ p ( b ) ) = ρϕ /sharp p ( a +i b ) . Therefore, for all z = ρe i θ ∈ C , with ρ = | z | , we have

For all z, w ∈ C 2 , let us define:

$$\varphi _ { p } ^ { \natural - 1 } ( z ) = \rho ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \cos \theta ) + i \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ( \sin \theta ) ) . \\ \intertext { u s e f i n e } \rho _ { p } = \rho _ { p } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } | ( 1 - | ( 1 + 2 ) + 1 | ) | ^ { 2 } \intertext { s u n d e f i n e } \intertext { p r } 1 + \frac { 1 } { 2 } | ( 1 + 2 ) + 1 | + 2 | ( 1 + 2 ) | = 0 .$$

It follows that if z = a +i b and w = c +i d , then:

Equivalently

$$\text {one} \colon & & z ^ { \ p } \cdot w = \varphi _ { p } ^ { \flat } ^ { \flat - 1 } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ^ { \flat } ( z ) \varphi _ { p } ^ { \flat } ( w ) \right ) \\ \text {and } w = c + i d , \text { then} \colon & &$$

$$z ^ { \ p } \cdot w & = \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ( a ) \varphi _ { p } ( b ) - \varphi _ { p } ( b ) \varphi _ { p } ( d ) \right ) + i \varphi _ { p } ^ { - 1 } \left ( \varphi _ { p } ( a ) \varphi _ { p } ( c ) + \varphi _ { p } ( b ) \varphi _ { p } ( c ) \right ) . \\ \\ \text {Equivalently}$$

$$z \stackrel { p } { \cdot } w & = ( a b - b d ) + i \left ( a d + b c \right ) . \\ \intertext { l i n i t w h o w } \intertext { o n t h i n t w h o w } \intertext { i n t h e f f } \intertext { o n t h e f f }$$

Along this line, taking the limit with respect to the product topology of R 2 , we define the product:

$$z \otimes w = \lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } z ^ { \ p } \cdot w = ( a b \, \Box \, b d ) + i \left ( a d \, \mathbb { E } \, b c \right ) .$$

Note that this product is equivalent to the matrix product defined in [11] for matrices representing complex numbers. We have for all complex numbers of the form z = a +i b and w = c +i d :

$$\left ( \begin{matrix} a & - b \\ b & a \end{matrix} \right ) \otimes \left ( \begin{matrix} c & - d \\ d & c \end{matrix} \right ) = \left ( \begin{matrix} a c \, \Box b d & - ( d \, \Box b c ) \\ a d \, \Box b c & a c \, \Box b d \end{matrix} \right ) . \\$$

Moreover, for all p ∈ N , and all z = a +i b ∈ C we define the ϕ p -module of z as | z | p = ‖ ( a, b ) ‖ ϕ p . Similarly, | z | ∞ = ‖ ( a, b ) ‖ ∞ = max {| a | , | b |} . In the following, we also extend the operation /squareplus to the complex numbers. For all z = a +i b and w = c +i d , we have :

$$z \oplus w = ( a \oplus c ) + i ( b \oplus d ) .$$

We can then establish the following relations.

Lemma 3.3.1 We have the following properties:

- ( a ) For all z ∈ C , there exists some θ ∈ [0 , 8] such that

$$z = \| z \| _ { \infty } ( p \cos ( \theta ) + i \, p \sin ( \theta ) )$$

- ( b ) If z = a +i b then √ z /squaremultiply ¯ z = | z | ∞ = max {| a | , | b |} .
- ( d ) Suppose that z, w ∈ C /natural ∞ (0 , 1] , then z /squaremultiply w ∈ C /natural ∞ (0 , 1] .
- ( c ) If z = 0 , then z · 1 | z | 2 ∞ ¯ z = 1 .

/negationslash

- ( e ) Suppose that z, w ∈ C , then | z /squaremultiply w | ∞ = | z | ∞ | w | ∞ .

Proof: ( a ) Suppose that z = a +i b . If z = 0, the result is trivial. If z = 0 then

$$z & = \max \{ | a | , | b | \} \frac { a + i \, b } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } = | z | _ { \infty } \left ( \frac { a } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } + i \frac { b } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } \right ) . \\ \intertext { ( } z = \max \{ | a | , | b | \} \frac { a } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } = | z | _ { \infty } \left ( \frac { a } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } + i \frac { b } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } \right ) . \\$$

/negationslash

However ( a max {| a | , | b |} +i b max {| a | , | b |} ) ∈ C /natural ∞ (0 , 1] . Hence there is some θ ∈ [0 , 8] such that

Hence

$$\left ( \frac { a } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } + i \frac { b } { \max \{ | a | , | b | \} } \right ) = p \cos \theta + i \, \text {psin} \theta .$$

$$H e n c \\ & z = \| z \| _ { \infty } ( \rho c _ { 0 } ( \theta ) + i \sin ( \theta ) ) . \\ ( b ) & \, \text {we have } z \otimes \bar { a } \, \bar { z } \otimes ( a + i b ) \, \Box ( a - i b ) = ( a ^ { 2 } \, \Box b ^ { 2 } ) ^ { \prime } + i ( a \, \Box a \, \Box a ) = a ^ { 2 } \, \Box b ^ { 2 } = \max \{ | a | , | b | ^ { 2 } \, \text { which yields} \\ \text {the result. } ( c ) & \, \text {is immediate from } ( b ) . \\ ( d ) & \, \text {suppose } t \, \bar { z } \, = a + i b \, \text { and } w \, = c \, \pm i \, d \, \text { \ } \text {W-first assume that } z \, \in \bar { C } ^ { * } \, ( 0 \, 1 ) \, \text { This implies that}$$

- ( d ) Suppose that z = a + i b and w = c + i d . We first assume that z, w ∈ C /natural ∞ (0 , 1] . This implies that max {| a | , | b |} = max {| c | , | d |} = 1. By definition we have:

We need to prove that max { | ac /squareminus bd | , | ad /squareplus bc | } = 1 . We consider the following cases: ( i ) if | a | &lt; 1 and | c | &lt; 1 then | bd | = 1 and consequently | ac /squareminus bd | = 1; ( ii ) if | a | &lt; 1 and | d | &lt; 1 then | bc | = 1, therefore | ad /squareplus bc | = 1; ( iii ) if | c | &lt; 1 and | b | &lt; 1 then | ad | = 1 and we deduce that | ad /squareplus bc | = 1; ( iv ) if | b | &lt; 1 and | d | &lt; 1 then | ac | = 1, hence we have | ac /squareminus bd | = 1.

$$z \, \Box \, w & = ( a c \, \Box \, b d ) + i \left ( a d \, \mathbb { E } \, b c \right ) . \\ \Box \, b d | , | a d \, \mathbb { E } \, b c | \right \} & = 1 . \text { We consider the follow}$$

Suppose now that | a | = | b | = | c | = | d | = 1. All we need to show is that we cannot have ac /squareminus bd = ad /squareplus bc = 0. In such a case we have ac = bd and ad = -bc . However, since | c | = | d | = 1, this implies that d 2 = -c 2 that is a contradiction. Consequently, we deduce that that if z, w ∈ C /natural ∞ (0 , 1] then z /squaremultiply w ∈ C /natural ∞ (0 , 1].

$$z \otimes w = | z | _ { \infty } | w | _ { \infty } \left ( p \cos ( \theta ) p \cos ( \alpha ) \, \exists \, \mathrm p \sin ( \theta ) p \sin ( \alpha ) + i \left ( p \cos ( \theta ) p \sin ( \alpha ) \, \oplus \, \mathrm p \sin ( \theta ) p \cos ( \alpha ) \right ) \right ) .$$

- ( e ) Suppose that z = | z | ∞ ( pcos( θ ) + i psin( θ ) ) and w = | w | ∞ ( pcos( α ) + i psin( α ) ) . We have:

Hence, since

$$| p \cos ( \theta ) p \cos ( \alpha ) \, \exists \, \mathrm \sin ( \theta ) p \sin ( \alpha ) + i \, ( p \cos ( \theta ) p \sin ( \alpha ) \oplus p \sin ( \theta ) p \cos ( \alpha ) ) | _ { \infty } = 1$$

we deduce the result. ✷

## 4 Algebraic Formulation of the Kuratowski-Peano Limit of a Line

## 4.1 Algebraic Formulation of a Line

In this section, we demonstrate that the non-associative algebraic structure we consider allows for establishing an algebraic formulation of any limiting line passing through two points. In the standard convex case it is easy to give an algebraic formulation of a line passing trough two different points. In such a case one can define the line passing trough x and y ( x = y ) as:

/negationslash

$$\mathcal { D } ( x , y ) = \{ t x + s y \, \colon s + t = 1 , s , t \in \mathbb { R } \} .$$

Note that there is no restriction imposing the non-negativity of s and t which limits a line to a line-segment. Paralleling this definition one can define a ϕ p -line as:

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { ( p ) } ( x , y ) = \{ t x + s y \colon s + t = 1 , s , t \in \mathbb { R } \} . \\ \intertext { i n } \left [ 8 ] \text { that the subset } \{ t x \oplus s y \colon \max \{ s , t \} = 1 , s , t \geq 0 \right \} \text { is not path-connected and} \\$$

It was pointed out in [8] that the subset { tx /squareplus sy : max { s, t } = 1 , s, t ≥ 0 } is not path-connected and does not describe, over R n , the convex hull in the limit of { x, y } . To that end it was shown in [8] that Co ∞ ( x, y ) = { tx /squareplus rx /squareplus sy /squareplus wy : max { t, r, s, w } = 1 , t, r, s, w ≥ 0 } . In what follows, we take a parallel approach to give the algebraic description of a line. Let us consider the following subset:

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \coloneqq \left \{ t x \oplus r x \oplus s y \oplus w y \colon t \oplus r \oplus s \oplus w = 1 , t , r , s , w \in \mathbb { R } \right \} . \\ \intertext { a m a 4 . 1 . 1 } \text { For all } x , y \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \text { with } x \neq y ,$$

Lemma 4.1.1 For all x, y ∈ R n with x = y ,

/negationslash

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \subset \underset { p \longrightarrow \infty } { L i } \mathcal { D } ^ { ( p ) } ( x , y ) .$$

Proof: Suppose that z ∈ { tx /squareplus rx /squareplus sy /squareplus wy : t /squareplus r /squareplus s /squareplus w = 1 , t, r, s, w ∈ R } . By definition, there exist α 1 , α 2 , β 1 , β 2 ∈ R with α 1 /squareplus α 2 /squareplus β 1 /squareplus β 2 = 1 and such that

$$z = \alpha _ { 1 } x \, \mathbb { E } \, \alpha _ { 2 } x \, \mathbb { E } \, \beta _ { 1 } y \, \mathbb { E } \, \beta _ { 2 } y .$$

Since α 1 /squareplus α 2 /squareplus β 1 /squareplus β 2 = 1, there exists some p 0 ∈ N such that, for all p ≥ p 0 , α 1 p + α 2 p + β 1 p + β 2 = 0. For all p ≥ p 0 , define

/negationslash

By construction, for all p ≥ p 0 , z ( p ) ∈ D ( p ) ( x, y ). Taking the limit on both sides yields:

$$z ^ { ( p ) } = \frac { 1 } { \alpha _ { 1 } \, ^ { \, p } + \alpha _ { 2 } \, ^ { \, p } + \beta _ { 1 } \, ^ { \, p } + \beta _ { 2 } } \, ( \alpha _ { 1 } x + \alpha _ { 2 } x + \beta _ { 1 } y + \beta _ { 2 } y ) . \\ \intertext { z } \intertext { a l l } \intertext { p > p _ { 0 } , \, z ^ { ( p ) } \in \mathcal { P } ^ { ( p ) } ( x , y ) . \, T a k i n g \, t h e \, l i m i t \, o n \, b o t h \, s i d e s \, v i e l d s \colon }$$

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } z ^ { ( p ) } & = \frac { 1 } { \alpha _ { 1 } \oplus \alpha _ { 2 } \oplus \beta _ { 1 } \oplus \mathbb { B } _ { 2 } } \left ( \alpha _ { 1 } x \oplus \alpha _ { 2 } x \oplus \beta _ { 1 } y \oplus \beta _ { 2 } y \right ) \\ & = \alpha _ { 1 } x \oplus \alpha _ { 2 } x \oplus \beta _ { 1 } y \oplus \beta _ { 2 } y = z .$$

Consequently, z ∈ Li p -→ + ∞ D ( p ) ( x, y ). ✷

Lemma 4.1.2 Let { ( s ( p ) , t ( p ) ) } p ∈ N be sequence of R 2 . Suppose there is an increasing subsequence { p q } q ∈ N of natural numbers such that s ( p q ) p q + t ( p q ) = 1 and lim q -→∞ ( s ( p q ) , t ( p q ) ) = ( s, t ) . We have the following properties:

- ( a ) If max { | s | , | t | } &gt; 1 then s = -t .
- ( c ) If min { | s | , | t | } ≤ 1 then max { s, t } = 1 .
- ( b ) If s = -t then | s | = | t | ≥ 1 .
- ( d ) If s = -t then max { s, t } = 1 .

Proof: ( a ) In such a case if | s | &gt; 1 then t = lim q -→∞ t p q = lim q -→∞ 1 p q -s p q = -s . The proof is symmetrical if t &gt; 1. ( b ) Let us prove that in such a case we have s 1 and t 1. If s &lt; 1 then t = lim t p q =

| | | | ≥ | | ≥ | | q -→∞ lim q -→∞ 1 p q -s p q = 1, which contradicts s = -t . Similarly, if | t | &lt; 1 we have a contradiction. Therefore | s | ≥ 1 and | t | ≥ 1. ( c ) If s = 1, then the conclusion is obvious. If | s | &lt; 1, then t = lim q -→∞ t p q = lim q -→∞ 1 p q -s p q = 1 p q

/negationslash and max { s, t } = 1. To conclude if s = -1, then t = lim q -→∞ t p q = lim q -→∞ 1 + 1 = 1, which ends the proof of ( c ). ( d ) From ( a ), s = -t implies that max { | s | , | t | } ≤ 1. Hence min { | s | , | t | } ≤ 1 and the result is then immediate from ( c ). ✷

The next lemma is a preliminary result to show the upper limit of the sequence {D ( p ) } p ∈ N is identical to D ∞ .

which yields the result. ✷

Proposition 4.1.4 For all x, y ∈ R n with x = y , for all i ∈ [ n ] such that sx i = -ty i .

/negationslash

Proof: Suppose that z ∈ Ls p -→∞ D ( p ) ( x, y ). In such a case there exists an increasing sequence of natural numbers { p k } k ∈ N and sequence { z ( p k ) } k ∈ N with z ( p k ) ∈ D ( p k ) ( x, y ) for all k and lim q -→∞ z ( p k ) = z . This implies that there exists a sequence { s ( p k ) , t ( p k ) } k ∈ N ⊂ R × R such that

$$z ^ { ( p _ { k } ) } = t ^ { ( p _ { k } ) } x + s ^ { ( p _ { k } ) } y ,$$

with s ( p k ) p k + t ( p k ) = 1 for all k . Let us prove that { ( s ( p k ) , t ( p k ) ) } q ∈ N is a bounded sequence. Suppose that this is not the case and let us show a contradiction. Suppose for example that { s ( p k ) } k ∈ N is not bounded. An elementary calculus shows that since t ( p k ) = 1 p k -s ( p k ) . Thus:

$$z ^ { ( p _ { k } ) } = x ^ { \ p _ { k } } + s ^ { ( p _ { k } ) } ( y ^ { \ p _ { k } } - x ) .$$

/negationslash

However lim k -→∞ y p k -x = y /squareminus x . Since x = y , y /squareminus x = 0 and this implies that lim k -→∞ ‖ z ( p q ) ‖ = ∞ that is a contradiction. Consequently { s ( p k ) } k ∈ N is bounded. Since s ( p k ) = 1 p k -t ( p k ) this also implies that { t ( p k ) } k ∈ N is bounded. Therefore, we deduce that the sequence { ( s ( p k ) , t ( p k ) ) } k ∈ N is bounded. Consequently one can extract an increasing subsequence { p k m } m ∈ N such that

$$\lim _ { m \longrightarrow \infty } ( s ^ { ( p _ { k _ { m } } ) } , t ^ { ( p _ { k _ { m } } ) } ) = ( s , p ) .$$

Let us denote I = { i ∈ [ n ] : sx i /squareplus ty i = 0 } . For all i / ∈ I , since sx i = -ty i we have

$$\lim _ { m \longrightarrow \infty } s ^ { ( p _ { k _ { m } } ) } x _ { i } ^ { \ p _ { k _ { m } } } + t ^ { ( p _ { k _ { m } } ) } y _ { i } = s x _ { i } \oplus t y _ { i } ,$$

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } \mathcal { D } ^ { ( p ) } ( x , y ) = \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) .$$

Proof: To prove this result, we need to establish that Ls p -→∞ D ( p ) ( x, y ) ⊂ { tx /squareplus rx /squareplus sy /squareplus wy : t /squareplus r /squareplus s /squareplus w = 1 , t, r, s, w ∈ R } . Suppose that z ∈ Ls p -→∞ D ( p ) ( x, y ). By hypothesis, there exists an increasing sequence of natural numbers { p q } q ∈ N and sequence { z ( p q ) } q ∈ N with z ( p q ) = t ( p q ) x p q + s ( p q ) y ∈ D ( p q ) ( x, y ) for all q such that lim q -→∞ z ( p q ) = z . Moreover, lim p -→∞ ( s ( p q ) , t ( p q ) ) = ( s, p ) and

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } x _ { i } \stackrel { p _ { q } } { + } t ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } y _ { i } = s x _ { i } \oplus t y _ { i } , \quad ( 1 )$$

for all i such that sx i = -ty i . Let I = { i ∈ [ n ] : sx i /squareplus ty i = 0 } . We consider three cases. ( a ) I = ∅ . If min {| s | , | t |} &gt; 1 then, from Lemma 4.1.2.(a), s = -t . Let us consider the vector

$$s x \, \mathbb { E } \, x \, \mathbb { E } \left ( 1 - \epsilon \right ) y \, \mathbb { E } \, t y ,$$

where /epsilon1 &gt; 0 is sufficiently small. Clearly, we have s /squareplus 1 /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) /squareplus t = 1 /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) = 1. Moreover, since | s | = | t | &gt; 1, for all i ∈ [ n ] we have sx i /squareplus ty i = sx i /squareplus x i /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) y i /squareplus ty i . From equation (1)

Lemma 4.1.3 Let x, y ∈ R n with x = y and suppose that z ∈ Ls p -→∞ D ( p ) ( x, y ) . Then there exists a sequence { ( s ( p ) , t ( p ) ) } p ∈ N ⊂ R 2 and an increasing subsequence { p q } q ∈ N of natural numbers such that s ( p q ) p q + t ( p q ) = 1 , lim q -→∞ ( s ( p q ) , t ( p q ) ) = ( s, t ) and

$$z _ { i } = s x _ { i } \, \mathbb { E } \, t y _ { i } ,$$

$$z = s x \, \mathbb { E } \, t y = s x \, \mathbb { E } \, x \, \mathbb { E } \, ( 1 - \epsilon ) y \, \mathbb { E } \, t y . \\ \intertext { s u m i s } \left ( | \, | _ { 1 } | \, | k | \right ) < 1 \, t y = s x \, \mathbb { E } \, x \, \mathbb { E } \, ( 1 - \epsilon ) y \, \mathbb { E } \, t y .$$

Therefore z ∈ D ∞ ( x, y ). If min {| s | , | t |} ≤ 1 then, from Lemma 4.1.2, max { s, t } = 1. Suppose that t = 1. Then, sx /squareplus ty = sx /squareplus 0 x /squareplus y /squareplus y and s /squareplus 0 /squareplus 1 /squareplus 1 = 1. One can proceeds symmetrically if s = 1.

- ( b ) I = ∅ and for all i ∈ I , x i = y i . In such a case for all i ∈ I , z ( p q ) i = x i = z i . For all i ∈ I , sx i = -ty i = -tx i and this implies that s = -t . From Lemma Lemma 4.1.2.(b) we have | s | ≥ 1 and | t | ≥ 1. Let us consider the vector

$$s x \, \mathbb { E } \, x \, \mathbb { E } \left ( 1 - \epsilon \right ) y \, \mathbb { E } \, t y , \\ \intertext { s x \, \mathbb { E } \, x \, \mathbb { E } } y \, \sin \sigma = \sigma + \mu \, \mathbb { m } h \, \sigma \, \sigma \, \mathbb { m } \, \Pi$$

where /epsilon1 &gt; 0 is sufficiently small. Clearly, since s = -t , we have s /squareplus 1 /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) /squareplus t = 1 /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) = 1. If i ∈ I then, since s = -t and x i = y i , one has sx i /squareplus x i /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) y i /squareplus ty i = x i /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) y i = x i = y i = z i .

- ( c ) I = ∅ and there is some i 0 ∈ I , such that x i 0 = y i 0 . We first prove that in such a case we have s = -t . Suppose that this is not the case. We have sx i 0 /squareplus ty i 0 = sx i 0 /squareplus ( -s ) y i 0 = 0. However this implies x i 0 = y i 0 that is a contradiction. Moreover, from Lemma 4.1.2.(c) we have max {| s | , | t |} = 1 and max { s, t } = 1. Assume for example that t = 1.

If i / ∈ I then, since sx i = -tx i , | s | ≥ 1 and | t | ≥ 1, we have sx i /squareplus x i /squareplus (1 -/epsilon1 ) y i /squareplus ty i = sx i /squareplus ty i = z i . We conclude that z ∈ D ∞ ( x, y ).

Suppose that i ∈ I . We have ty i = y i = -sx i and therefore

By hypothesis lim k -→∞ z ( p q ) i = z i . Hence the sequence { s ( p q ) p q -st ( p q ) } q ∈ N has a limit. Let us denote

$$s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } x _ { i } + t ^ { p _ { q } } y _ { i } = s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } x _ { i } \stackrel { p _ { q } } { - } s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } x _ { i } = \left ( s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } \stackrel { p _ { q } } { - } s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } \right ) x _ { i } . \\ \lim i t s _ { x _ { i } } + \tilde { x } _ { i } = \tilde { x } _ { i } \, \ H o n o { \, } t \, \sec o w n o { v e c { o n } } _ { x _ { i } } \left [ \rho _ { i } \right ] ^ { p _ { q } } \rho _ { i + } ( p _ { q } ) \right \} \quad h o n o { \, } \lim i t \, \left [ \rho _ { i } \right ] \left [ \rho _ { i + } \right ]$$

$$s ^ { \prime } = \lim _ { q \longrightarrow \infty } s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } \stackrel { p _ { q } } { - } s t ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } .$$

By hypothesis we have z i = s ′ x i . Note that, since

$$| s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } - s t ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } | & \leq | s ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } | ^ { \frac { p _ { q } } { + } } \, | s t ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } | , \\ ( | + | + | ) & \, \cdot \, | s | \, ,$$

we have taking the limit | s ′ | ≤ max {| s | , t | s |} ≤ | s | . We consider two cases.

- ( i ) Suppose that s ′ = -s . Let us consider the vector

$$s x \oplus s ^ { \prime } x \oplus 0 y \oplus y .$$

If i ∈ I then, since sx i = -y i , we have w i = sx i /squareplus s ′ x i /squareplus 0 y i /squareplus y i = s ′ x i = z i .

/negationslash

If i / ∈ I , then since s = -s ′ , we have either s = s ′ or | s ′ | &lt; | s | . Hence, sx i /squareplus s ′ x i /squareplus 0 y i /squareplus y i = sx i /squareplus y i = z i . It follows that z = sx /squareplus s ′ x /squareplus 0 y /squareplus y. Moreover, since -s = t = 1 and | s ′ | ≤ | s | , we have s /squareplus s ′ /squareplus 0 /squareplus 1 = 1. Hence z ∈ D ∞ ( x, y ).

- ( ii ) Suppose now that s ′ = -s . Let us consider the vector

$$s x \, \mathbb { E } \, 0 x \, \mathbb { E } \, y \, \mathbb { E } \, y .$$

If i ∈ I then, since sx i = -y i , we have sx i /squareplus 0 x i /squareplus y i /squareplus y i = y i . However since y i = -sx i , we deduce that y i = s ′ x i = z i .

/negationslash

If i / ∈ I then, sx i = -y i . Thus, we have sx i /squareplus 0 x i /squareplus y i /squareplus y i = sx i /squareplus y i = z i . Hence, we conclude that z = sx /squareplus 0 x /squareplus y /squareplus y. Moreover, since max {| s | , | t |} = 1, s /squareplus 0 /squareplus 1 /squareplus 1 = 1.

Consequently, we have shown that z ∈ { tx /squareplus rx /squareplus sy /squareplus wy : t /squareplus r /squareplus s /squareplus w = 1 , t, r, s, w ∈ R } . If s = 1 the proof is symmetrical. Hence

The image is a graph of a function, specifically a hyperbola, with the equation y = 1/x. The graph is plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis representing the horizontal variable x and the y-axis representing the vertical variable y. The hyperbola is symmetric about the origin, with its vertex at the origin (0,0). The graph shows the hyperbola opening upwards and to the right, with the asymptotes being the x-axis. The graph is continuous and smooth, with no breaks or gaps. The graph is drawn in black, with the x-axis and y-axis being straight lines. The origin (0,0) is clearly marked on the graph.

In the next example, it is shown that the formalism described above allows us to define subsets of R n that are unbounded.

Example 4.1.5 Suppose that n = 3 and let us consider the points x = (3 , -2 , 1) and y = (1 , -1 , 1) . Suppose that t = 1 , r = δ = -w and s = 0 where δ is a real number. Clearly, t /squareplus r /squareplus s /squareplus w = 1 /squareplus δ /squareplus ( -δ ) /squareplus 0 = 1 . It follows that

$$I \text { follows that } \\ z _ { \delta } \coloneqq t x \oplus r x \oplus s y \oplus w y = t \left ( \begin{matrix} 3 \\ - 2 \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right ) \oplus \delta \left ( \begin{matrix} 3 \\ - 2 \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right ) \oplus \exists \left ( - \delta \right ) \left ( \begin{matrix} 1 \\ - 1 \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right ) \oplus 0 \left ( \begin{matrix} 1 \\ - 1 \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right ) = \left ( \begin{matrix} 3 \delta \\ - 2 \delta \end{matrix} \right ) \in \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) . \\ \\ I \text { follows that }$$

$$\lim _ { | \delta | \longrightarrow \infty } \| z _ { \delta } \| = + \infty .$$

In the following it is shown that D ∞ ( x, y ) is path connected.

Proof: Suppose that u, v ∈ D ∞ ( x, y ) with u = v . Then, there exists a sequence { ( u ( p ) , v ( p ) ) } p ∈ N such that for all p ∈ N ( u ( p ) , v ( p ) ) ∈ D ( p ) ( x, y ) × D ( p ) ( x, y ) and lim p -→∞ ( u ( p ) , v ( p ) ) = ( u, v ). Let I ( u, v ) = { i ∈ [ n ] : u i v i &lt; 0 } . Since lim p -→∞ ( u ( p ) , v ( p ) ) = ( u, v ), there is some p 0 ∈ N such that for all p ≥ p 0 , I ( u, v ) = I ( u ( p ) , v ( p ) ). For all i ∈ I ( u, v ) and all p ≥ p 0 , there is a unique point γ ( p ) i ∈ Co p ( x, y ) such that { γ ( p ) i } = H i ∩D ( p ) ( x, y ) where, for all i ∈ [ n ], H i = { x ∈ R n : x i = 0 } . For all i ∈ I ( u, v ), that is a nonempty subset of D ∞ ( x, y ). Let γ i ∈ Ls p -→∞ ( H i ∩ D ( p ) ( x, y ) ) . This implies that there is an increasing sequence { p q } such that

$$\lim _ { q \longrightarrow \infty } \gamma _ { i } ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } = \gamma _ { i } \in H _ { i } \cap \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) .$$

Let us denote n ( u, v ) = Card I ( u, v ). For all p ≥ p 0 one can find a sequence { i k } k ∈ [ n ( u,v ) -1] such that

$$\gamma _ { i _ { k } } ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } \cdot \gamma _ { i _ { k + 1 } } ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } \geq 0 .$$

$$\lim _ { q \longrightarrow \infty } C o ^ { p _ { q } } \left ( \gamma _ { i _ { k } } ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } , \gamma _ { i _ { k + 1 } } ^ { ( p _ { q } ) } \right ) = C o ^ { \infty } \left ( \gamma _ { i _ { k } } , \gamma _ { i _ { k + 1 } } \right ) .$$

It follows that

However,

Now, since any set Co ∞ ( γ i k , γ i k +1 ) is path-connected, it follows that there exists a continuous map ψ : [0 , 1] -→ D ∞ ( x, y ) such that ψ (0) = u and ψ (1) = v . ✷

The image is a geometric diagram that appears to be a portion of a mathematical or physical figure. It features a coordinate system with axes labeled x and y, and a curve that starts at a point on the y-axis and extends to the right, then slightly upwards, and finally to the right again. The curve is not a standard geometric shape like a circle or square, but rather a free-form line that suggests it could be a part of a more complex figure. There are no other objects, text, or specific markings that provide additional context. The image is a simple line drawing with no shading or color, and it is presented in a clear, uncluttered manner.

The diagram consists of a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The origin is denoted as point O. The x-axis is denoted as the horizontal line passing through the origin. The y-axis is denoted as the vertical line passing through the origin. The z-axis is denoted as the line perpendicular to the xy-plane passing through the origin.

Figure 10 depicts the case of a 3-dimensional Ϝ -line passing trough x and y . For i = 1 , 2 , 3, γ i is the intersection between the Ϝ -line and the 2-dimensions plane with equation x i = 0 .

Corollary 4.1.7 For all x, y ∈ R n with x = y ,

/negationslash

$$C o ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \subset \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) .$$

$$C o ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \coloneqq \left \{ t x \oplus r x \oplus s y \oplus w y \colon t \oplus r \oplus s \oplus w = 1 , t , r , s , w \in \mathbb { R } _ { + } \right \} .$$

Proof: From [8]

The result is then immediate, since Co ∞ ( x, y ) is the set of all the B -convex combinations such that t, r, s, w ≥ 0 . ✷

Corollary 4.1.7 does not imply that D ∞ is idempotent symmetric convex. In general, this is not true. This can be seen in Figure 10, where x /squareminus y and y /squareminus x belong to D ∞ ( x, y ). However, ( x /squareminus y ) /squareplus ( y /squareminus x ) = 0 / ∈ D ∞ ( x, y ) .

Proposition 4.1.8 Let Y be an idempotent symmetric subspace of R n . Then, for all x, y ∈ R n with x = y we have D ∞ ( x, y ) ⊂ Y .

Proof: We have shown that

$$\text {we have shown that} \\ \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) = \left \{ t x \oplus r x \oplus s y \oplus w y \colon t \oplus r \oplus s \oplus w = 1 , t , r , s , w \in \mathbb { R } \right \} . \\ \intertext { s o u t i o n $ 2 . 1 . 1 $ 14 the r e s u l t is then immediate . }$$

From Proposition 2.1.14 the result is then immediate. ✷

Notice that since ( R n , /squareplus , · ) and ( ˜ M n , ˜ /squareplus , ⊗ ) are isomorphic one can deduce the algebraic form of a line passing trough z and u . The multiplicative neutral element of · is replaced with 0 = 1 ˜ M and we have

In the next statement, it is shown that, for all x, y ∈ R n with x = y , the line D ∞ ( x, y ) contains two half lines spanned from two specific points. D ∞ ( x, y ) is called the Ϝ -line spanned by x and y .

Proposition 4.2.1 Let x, y ∈ R n and suppose that x = y . Let I = { i ∈ [ n ] : x i = y i } and J = [ n ] \ I . We have the following inclusions:

( a ) If J = ∅ then

$$\{ t ( y \ominus x ) \colon t \in [ 1 , \infty [ \} \subset \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \quad a n d \quad \{ t ( x \square y ) \colon t \in [ 1 , \infty [ \} \subset \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) .$$

( b ) If J = ∅ then

$$& \text {where } x _ { [ J ] } = \sum _ { k \in J } x _ { k } e _ { k } = \sum _ { k \in J } y _ { k } e _ { k } = y _ { [ J ] } . \\ & \text {Proof} \colon ( a ) \text { We first note that since } J = \emptyset \text { and }$$

$$x _ { [ J ] } + \left \{ t ( y \, \Box x _ { \ } ) \colon t \in [ 1 , \infty [ \, ] \, \Big \{ \subset \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \quad a n d \quad x _ { [ J ] } + \left \{ t ( x \, \Box y ) \, \colon t \in [ 1 , \infty [ \, ] \, \Big \} \subset \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) , \\ \\ \intertext { w h e r e } x _ { [ J ] } = \sum x _ { \in } x _ { \infty } = \sum y _ { \infty } e _ { \infty } = y _ { [ J ] } ,$$

Proof: ( a ) We first note that since J = ∅ and I = [ n ]

For all t ≥ 1, let us consider the vector

Since t ≥ 1, we have

Moreover t /squareplus 1 /squareplus 0 /squareplus ( -t ) = 1. Clearly z ∈ { tx /squareplus rx /squareplus sy /squareplus wy : t /squareplus r /squareplus s /squareplus w = 1 , t, r, s, w ∈ R } , which proves the first part of ( a ). The proof of the second part is symmetrical swapping x and y . ( b ) Let us denote R [ I ] = { ∑ k ∈ I x k e k : x ∈ R n } . By hypothesis x, y ∈ x [ J ] + R [ I ] . Hence D ∞ ( x, y ) ⊂ x [ J ] + R [ I ] . Let n I = Card( I ) and let D ∞ [ I ] ( x, y ) be the canonical decomposition of D ∞ ( x, y ) over R [ I ] . By definition for all i ∈ I we have x i = y i . Since R [ I ] is isomorphic to its restriction projection onto R n I we deduce from ( a ) that

$$z = t x \, \mathbb { E } \left ( - t \right ) y .$$

$$z & = t x \, \mathbb { E } \, x \, \mathbb { E } \, 0 y \, \mathbb { E } \left ( - t \right ) y . \\ & \quad ( \begin{matrix} z = t x \, \mathbb { E } \, x \, \mathbb { E } \, 0 y \, \mathbb { E } \left ( - t \right ) y . \end{matrix} )$$

$$\{ t ( x _ { [ I ] } \square y _ { [ I ] } ) \colon t \in [ 1 , \infty [ \} \subset \mathcal { D } _ { [ I ] } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) .$$

However D ∞ ( x, y ) = x [ J ] + D ∞ [ I ] ( x, y ). Moreover x [ J ] /squareminus y [ J ] = 0 . Hence

$$x _ { [ J ] } + \{ t ( x \colon \exists y ) \colon t \in [ 1 , \infty [ \} } & = x _ { [ J ] } + \{ t ( x _ { [ I ] } \sqcup y _ { [ I ] } ) \colon t \in [ 1 , \infty [ \} } \\ & \subset x _ { [ J ] } + \mathcal { D } _ { [ I ] } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \\ & \subset \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) .$$

The proof of the second part of the statement is symmetrical. ✷

Notice that Proposition 4.2.1.(b) can be deduced from Proposition 4.2.1.(a) by considering the canonical isomorphism ψ I defined from the set { z ∈ R n : z j = 0 , j / ∈ I } to R m where m = Card( I ).

Let x, y ∈ R n . The half lines D + ( x, y ) = { t ( x /squareminus y ) : t ∈ [1 , ∞ [ } and D -( x, y ) = { t ( y /squareminus x ) : t ∈ [1 , ∞ [ } are respectively called the upper and lower half-lines components of the Ϝ -line D ∞ ( x, y ).

Example 4.2.2 Let us consider the case proposed in 4.1.5 with x = (3 , -2 , 1) and y = (1 , -1 , 1) . In such a case I = { 1 , 2 } and J = { 3 } . We have:

and

It follows that and

$$x \Box y = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \, \Box \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ - 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \\ x _ { \{ 3 \} } = y _ { \{ 3 \} } = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \, .$$

$$y = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \, \Box \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ - 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$= \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} .$$

$$D ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \supset & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + \left \{ t \left ( - 2 \right ) , t \in \mathbb { R } \right \} = \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ - 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \colon t \in \mathbb { R } \right \} = \mathcal { D } _ { + } ( x , y ) \\$$

$$D ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \supset \left ( \begin{matrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right ) + \left \{ t \left ( \begin{matrix} - 3 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right ) , t \in \mathbb { R } \right \} = \left \{ \left ( \begin{matrix} - 3 t \\ 2 t \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right ) \colon t \in \mathbb { R } \right \} = \mathcal { D } _ { - } ( x , y ) .$$

## 4.3 Parallel Lines

From Proposition 4.2.1, any Ϝ -lines contains two half-lines components. Let D ∞ ( x, y ) and E ∞ ( u, v ) be two Ϝ -lines respectively spanned from x and y and u and v . We say that E ∞ ( u, v ) and D ∞ ( x, y ) are Ϝ -parallel if x /squareminus y ∝ u /squareminus v . Equivalently, this means that x /squareminus y and u /squareminus v are collinear, that is there is some α ∈ R \{ 0 } such that ( x /squareminus y ) = α ( u /squareminus v ). From Proposition 4.2.1, there exist two half lines components E -( u, v ) and E + ( u, v ) of E ∞ ( u, v ) and two half lines components D -( x, y ) and D + ( x, y ) of D ∞ ( x, y ) such that E + ( u, v ) ⊃ ( ⊂ ) D + ( x, y ) and E -( u, v ) ⊃ ( ⊂ ) D -( x, y ).

Traditional axioms of planar Euclidean geometry postulate that: ( a 1 ) a straight line may be drawn between any two points; ( a 2 ) any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely; ( a 3 ) a circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any given radius, ( a 4 ) all right angles are equal; ( v ) for any given point not on a given line, there is exactly one line through the point that does not meet the given line.

It is well known that the fifth axiom does not follow from the first four. Clearly, the geometric implications of the algebraic structure proposed in this paper do not conflict with the first 4 axioms. Not surprisingly, this is not the case for the fifth. In particular:

- ( i ) two distinct parallel lines may have an infinity of common points (Figure 12);
- ( ii ) there may exist an infinity of Ϝ -lines passing by two distinct points x and y (Figure 12);
- ( iii ) two secant lines may have an infinity of common points (Figure 13);
- ( iv ) a Ϝ -line may not be spanned by two distinct points it contains (Figure 13).

In the following a system of inequations characterizing a Ϝ -line that passes from two distinct points is provided. This we do by considering the suitable notion of determinant introduced in [10]. The next intermediary result establishes an algebraic description of the limit of a sequence of ϕ p -hyperplanes. The next result was established in [11].

Proposition 4.3.1 Let V be the n × n matrix with v i as i -th column for each i . Let V ( i ) be the matrix obtained from V by replacing line i with the transpose of the unit vector 1 1 n . Suppose that | V | ∞ = 0 . Let { H p ( V ) } p ∈ N be the sequence of ϕ p -hyperplanes passing trough each point v i . Then

$$\lim _ { p \longrightarrow \infty } H _ { p } ( V ) = \left \{ x \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } \colon \underbar { \bigcup } _ { i \in [ n ] } | V _ { ( i ) } | _ { \infty } x _ { i } \leq | V | _ { \infty } \leq \underbar { \bigcup } _ { i \in [ n ] } | V _ { ( i ) } | _ { \infty } x _ { i } \right \} .$$

Given two distinct points x, y ∈ R 2 , any point z ∈ D ( x, y ) satisfies the relation:

Equivalently, we have

$$\i s \, x , y & \in \mathbb { K } ; \, \text {any point} \, x \not \in D ( x , y ) \ \text {satisfies} \, ( \text {relation} \colon \\ & | z - x , z - y | = \left | \begin{matrix} z _ { 1 } - x _ { 1 } & z _ { 1 } - y _ { 1 } \\ z _ { 2 } - x _ { 2 } & z _ { 2 } - y _ { 2 } \end{matrix} \right | = 0 . \\ & ( x _ { 2 } - y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } + ( y _ { 1 } - x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } = | x , y | .$$

$$( x _ { 2 } - y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } + ( y _ { 1 } - x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } & = | x , y | . \\$$

$$\mathbb { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) & = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( x _ { 2 } \, \partial _ { y _ { 2 } } ) _ { z _ { 1 } } \, \bar { \cup } ( y _ { 1 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \, \leq & | x , y | _ { \infty } \leq ( x _ { 2 } \, \partial _ { y _ { 2 } } ) z _ { 1 } \, \stackrel { + } { \cup } ( y _ { 1 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \intertext { I n the following , we show that the equations of two parallel lines in the plane obey algebraic rules }$$

The following proposition establishes an analogous result in the case of the Ϝ -line D ∞ . This algebraic characterization is an immediate consequence of Proposition 4.3.1 (see [11]). Let x, y ∈ R 2 with x = y . Then:

In the following, we show that the equations of two parallel lines in the plane obey algebraic rules analogous to those of the linear case.

Lemma 4.3.2 Let D ∞ and E ∞ be two parallel Ϝ -lines of R 2 . Then there exists a ∈ R 2 , c, d ∈ R such that:

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } = \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon \langle a , z \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { - } \leq c \leq \langle a , z \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { + } \leq c \}$$

$$\mathcal { E } ^ { \infty } = \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon \langle a , z \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { - } \leq d \leq \langle a , z \rangle _ { \infty } ^ { + } \leq c \} .$$

Proof: Suppose now that D ∞ and E ∞ are two Ϝ -line respectively spanned from x, y and u, v , where x, y, u, v ∈ R 2 . By definition we have:

/negationslash

$$\mathcal { E } ^ { \infty } & = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( u _ { 2 } \, \Box v _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bigcup ( v _ { 1 } \, \Box u _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \leq | u , v | _ { \infty } \leq ( u _ { 2 } \, \Box v _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bigcup ( v _ { 1 } \, \Box u _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \text {If } \mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } \text { and } \mathcal { E } ^ { \infty } \text { are parallel then } ( u \, \Box v ) \, \subset ( x \, \Box y ) . \text { Therefore, there is a real number } \alpha \neq 0 \text { such that}$$

If D ∞ and E ∞ are parallel then ( u /squareminus v ) ∝ ( x /squareminus y ). Therefore, there is a real number α = 0 such that ( u /squareminus v ) = α ( x /squareminus y ). Hence:

$$( u \subseteq 0 ) & \quad \& ( u \subseteq y ) \ \text {R} \ \infty \\ & \quad \& \mathcal { E } ^ { \infty } = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon \alpha ( x _ { 2 } \oplus y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \ \bar { \ } \alpha ( y _ { 1 } \oplus x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \leq | u , v | _ { \infty } \leq \alpha ( x _ { 2 } \oplus y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \ \stackrel { + } { \wr } \ \alpha ( y _ { 1 } \oplus x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \text {Suppose that } \alpha > 0 , \text { then} \quad &$$

Suppose that α &gt; 0, then:

$$\text {Suppose that } & \mathcal { A } \succ 0 ; \text {, the} . \quad \text {and} . \quad \mathcal { A } \supseteq \mathcal { A } ^ { - 1 } | u _ { \ } v | _ { \infty } \leq ( x _ { 1 } \sqcup \mathcal { A } _ { 1 } \sqcup \mathcal { A } _ { 1 } ) z _ { 1 } \supseteq \mathcal { A } ^ { - 1 } | u _ { \ } v | _ { \infty } \leq ( x _ { 2 } \sqcup \mathcal { A } _ { 2 } ) z _ { 2 } \underbrace { \ + } ( y _ { 1 } \sqcup x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \Big \} . \\ & \mathcal { E } ^ { \infty } = \Big \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( x _ { 2 } \sqcup y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \sqcup ( y _ { 1 } \sqcup x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \supseteq \mathcal { A } ^ { - 1 } | u _ { \ } v | _ { \infty } \leq ( x _ { 2 } \sqcup y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \supseteq ( y _ { 1 } \sqcup x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \Big \} . \\ \intertext { We deduce the result taking } & a = x \sqcup y , \, c = | x , y | _ { \infty } , \, \text {and} \, d = \alpha ^ { - 1 } | u , v | _ { \infty } \text {. If } \alpha < 0 , \, t h e n \colon$$

$$\mathcal { E } ^ { \infty } = & \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( x _ { 2 } \, \partial y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bar { \cup } ( y _ { 1 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \, \right \} \alpha ^ { - 1 } | u , v | _ { \infty } \geq ( x _ { 2 } \, \partial y _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \underbrace { \cup } ( y _ { 1 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \intertext { S i n c . ( r o . \, \partial y _ { 2 } ) _ { z _ { 1 } } \, \bar { \cup } ( y _ { 1 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } ) = & \, - \left ( ( y _ { 0 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 1 } ^ { + } \, \underset { \cdot } { \underset { z _ { 1 } } { \underset { x _ { 1 } } { \cup } } } \right ) \, \text {and} \, ( x _ { 0 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } \, \cup \, z _ { 1 } ^ { + } \, ( x _ { 1 } \, \partial y _ { 1 } ) ) = & \, - \left ( ( y _ { 0 } \, \partial x _ { 1 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bar { \cup } \right )$$

We deduce the result taking a = x /squareminus y , c = | x, y | ∞ , and d = α -1 | u, v | ∞ . If α &lt; 0, then:

Since ( x 2 /squareminus y 2 ) z 1 -/slurbelow ( y 1 /squareminus x 1 ) = -( ( y 2 /squareminus x 2 ) z 1 + /slurbelow ( x 1 /squareminus y 1 ) ) and ( x 2 /squareminus y 2 ) z 1 + /slurbelow ( y 1 /squareminus x 1 ) = -( ( y 2 /squareminus x 2 ) z 1 -/slurbelow ( x 1 /squareminus y 1 ) ) we deduce that:

$$\mathcal { E } ^ { \infty } = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( y _ { 2 } \, \Box x _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bar { \cup } ( x _ { 1 } \, \Box y _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \leq | \alpha | ^ { - 1 } | u , v | _ { \infty } \leq ( y _ { 2 } \, \Box x _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bigcup ( x _ { 1 } \, \Box y _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \right \} .$$

and

Now note that, since D ∞ ( x, y ) = D ∞ ( y, x ), we also have

Hence, taking a = y /squareminus x , c = | y, x | ∞ and d = | α | -1 | u, v | ∞ yields the result. ✷

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( y _ { 2 } \, \Box \, x _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bigcup \, ( x _ { 1 } \, \Box \, y _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \leq | y , x | _ { \infty } \leq ( y _ { 2 } \, \Box \, x _ { 2 } ) z _ { 1 } \, \bigcup \, ( x _ { 1 } \, \Box \, y _ { 1 } ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \\ \text {Hence} \, \text {taking} \, \varrho \, \equiv \, y \, \Box \, x _ { 1 } \, \colon \, c \equiv | y _ { 1 } x _ { 1 } \, \Box \, \text {and} \, d \equiv | \alpha | ^ { - 1 } | y _ { 1 } | y _ { 1 } \, \text {olds the result} \, \Box \,$$

Example 4.3.3 Suppose that x = (3 , 1) , y = (1 , -2) , u = ( -2 , 4) and v = ( -6 , 1) . We have:

$$x \, \Box \, y & = \left ( \begin{matrix} 3 \, \Box \, 1 \\ 1 \, \Box \, ( - 2 ) \end{matrix} \right ) = \left ( \begin{matrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{matrix} \right ) \quad a n d \quad u \, \Box \, v = \left ( \begin{matrix} - 2 \, \Box \, ( - 6 ) \\ 4 \, \Box \, 1 \end{matrix} \right ) = \left ( \begin{matrix} 6 \\ 4 \end{matrix} \right ) .$$

It follows that u /squareminus v = 2( x /squareminus y ) . Moreover,

$$| x , y | _ { \infty } = 3 \cdot ( - 2 ) \, \Box \, 1 \cdot 1 = - 6 \quad a n d \quad | u , v | _ { \infty } = ( - 2 ) \cdot 1 \, \Box \, ( - 6 ) \cdot 4 = 2 4 .$$

Therefore:

Hence:

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon \left ( 1 \, \exists \, ( - 2 ) \right ) z _ { 1 } \, \subsetneq ( 1 \, \exists \, 3 ) z _ { 2 } \leq - 6 \leq ( 1 \, \exists \, ( - 2 ) ) z _ { 1 } \overset { + } { \sim } ( 1 \, \exists \, 3 ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \\ H e n c e \colon \quad & \left ( \begin{array} { c c } 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right )$$

In addition we have:

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( x , y ) \equiv \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon 2 z _ { 1 } \ \bar { \cup } \left ( \cdot - 3 \right ) z _ { 2 } \leq - 6 \leq 2 z _ { 1 } \ \underbrace { + } \left ( \cdot - 3 \right ) z _ { 2 } \right \} .$$

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( u , v ) & = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( 4 \, \Box ( - 1 ) ) z _ { 1 } \subseteq ( ( - 6 ) \, \Box ( - 2 ) ) z _ { 2 } \leq - 6 \leq ( 4 \, \Box ( - 1 ) ) z _ { 1 } \overset { + } { \bigcup } ( ( - 6 ) \, \Box ( - 2 ) ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \\ H e n c e \colon & \quad & \intertext { \mathcal { D } } H e n c e \colon & \quad & \intertext { o f } & \intertext { s u n t } H e n c e \colon & & \intertext { s u n t }$$

Hence:

Equivalently, by changing the sign and simplifying by 2:

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( u , v ) = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon ( - 4 ) z _ { 1 } \smile \bar { 6 } z _ { 2 } \leq 2 4 \leq ( - 4 ) z _ { 1 } \smile \bar { 6 } z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \intertext { b y \ c h a n g i n g \ t h e \ s i g n \ a n d \ s i m p l i f y i n g \ b y \ 2 \colon }$$

$$\mathcal { D } ^ { \infty } ( u , v ) = \left \{ z \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } \colon 2 z _ { 1 } \smile ( - 3 ) z _ { 2 } \leq - 1 2 \leq 2 z _ { 1 } \smile ( - 3 ) z _ { 2 } \right \} . \\ \intertext { i c e t h a t h e c o f f i c i e n t s } \ m u l t i p l { i n g } \ z _ { 1 } \ a n d \ z _ { 2 } \ a r e \ t h e \ s a m e \ t h e \ d i f f e r e n c e \ r e l a t i n g$$

We can notice that the coefficients multiplying z 1 and z 2 are the same the difference relating only to the constant term.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have explored certain geometric properties emerging from the deformation of a vector space structure defined over a scalar field. In particular, we have focused on notions of lines that can be seen as special limits of linear varieties. For future research, it would be valuable to investigate the connections between these notions and those typically derived from Max-Plus algebras, which are traditionally used in the formalism of tropical mathematics, as initiated in [29] and [27].
